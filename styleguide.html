        <h1>How we write</h1>
        <div class="outline">
          <p>We speak to the user in their language. We give them the information they want to know and we make sure they find it quickly.  </p>
       </div>
        <h2>The voice of GOV.UK</h2>
        <p> Our writing is:

        <li>serious but not pompous</li>
        <li>in the vernacular ;-)</li>
        <li>active and engaging</li>
        <li>trustworthy and official</li>
        <li>definitive and authoratitive</li>
        <li>incisive (but still human)</li>
        <li>brief, succinct and to the point</li>
        </p>
       
        <h2>No beaten bushes here!</h2>
        <p>Writing concisely We don't confound them with extra information, however useful we might think that is.

        , free of jargon, plain english, 

        no caveats, no unwieldy grammar, taking risks? "You can" not "you may be able to"
        
      
        </p>

        <h1>Content design</h1>
        <div class="outline">
          <p>We analysed our content needs and found we needed a suite of content formats. These different formats allow us to effectively answer user needs by designing content that's clear, rummageable and gives people confidence that they've got the right answer.</p>
       </div>
        <h2>Guides</h2>
          <p>Our guides are a set of related information about a specific topic (eg example) or life event (eg After someone dies). One guide has one or more related 'parts' - people can see the edges of a topic and choose to read the length and breadth or it or simply go straight to a specific section.</p>
          
        <h2>Answers</h2>
        <p>Our answers assume prior knowledge of a subject and answer one specific need, eg "What is the National Minimum wage rate?" We answer the question only and give the rate. We don't crowd the answer with surplus information. We also use answers to address popular needs (eg passport fees). We go into detail on [example] in a guide about the subject.</p>
      
        <h2>Benefits and schemes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Overview - give people the main things they want to know without going into detail - eg rate and how long it's paid for - separate out key points (not one long paragraph)</li>

          <li>Main sections - stick to the title / need - resist temptation to provide information around the subject (especially superfluous advice) - use examples for complex calculations (use example markdown) - stick to common case - any edge cases get put in 'Further information'</li>

          <li>Further information - this isn't a dumping ground - content still needs to be useful - if you can't find a place for it, suggest not using it - key information for this section: effect on other benefits, appeals and edge cases - also more information on how things are worked out</li>
        </ul>
