        <h1>How we write</h1>
        <div class="outline">
          <p>We speak to the user in their language. We give them the information they want to know and we make sure they find it quickly.  </p>
       </div>
        <h2>The voice of GOV.UK</h2>
        <p> Our writing is:

        <li>serious but not pompous</li>
        <li>in the vernacular ;-)</li>
        <li>active and engaging</li>
        <li>trustworthy and official</li>
        <li>definitive and authoratitive</li>
        <li>incisive (but still human)</li>
        <li>brief, succinct and to the point</li>
        </p>
       
        <h2>No beaten bushes here!</h2>
        <p>Writing concisely We don't confound them with extra information, however useful we might think that is.

        , free of jargon, plain english, 

        no caveats, no unwieldy grammar, taking risks? "You can" not "you may be able to"
        
      
        </p>

        <h1>Getting rid of advice</h1>
        <h2>??</h2>

        <h1>Content design</h1>
        <div class="outline">
          <p>We analysed our content needs and found we needed a suite of content formats. These different formats allow us to effectively answer user needs by designing content that's clear, rummageable and gives people confidence that they've got the right answer.</p>
       </div>
        <h2>Guides</h2>
        
              
          <li>Don't force a linear reading pattern</li>
          <li>Don't duplicate information but also don't assume people have read all parts of the guide</li>
        
        </ul>

        <h2>Answers</h2>
        <p>Answers assume prior knowledge and answer a popular - and specific - need (so you do not need to explain terms or provide context). </p>
        <p>Stick exclusively to the answer - don't be tempted to include extra information, however useful this might appear to be.</p>

          <li>Answer summary - one sentence summing up the answer for common case - get the basic information in this summary - not an introduction - use summary tags</li>

          <li>Body - expand on summary with any necessary detail - be strict with information you include - don't stray off topic - stick to task - light touch on words even if this means compromising caveats - no need to repeat info in subhead</li>

          <li>Subheads - as close to search terms as possible - No need for the 'if' (eg 'You're working abroad') - H2 are primary subs</li>

          <li>Formatting - don't break up text with too many subheads - use formatting options (eg callouts) but not gratuitously - use accessibility formatting</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When does an answer become a guide?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>When the answer can't be simplified - eg too many variables - such as 'What hours your child can work' - for this, the answer depends on too many things, such as the age of your child and the type of job</li>

          <li>When it can't be summed up</li>

          <li>When it's low popularity search - it can form part of a longer guide so it doesn't clog up the results page</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Benefits and schemes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Overview - give people the main things they want to know without going into detail - eg rate and how long it's paid for - separate out key points (not one long paragraph)</li>

          <li>Main sections - stick to the title / need - resist temptation to provide information around the subject (especially superfluous advice) - use examples for complex calculations (use example markdown) - stick to common case - any edge cases get put in 'Further information'</li>

          <li>Further information - this isn't a dumping ground - content still needs to be useful - if you can't find a place for it, suggest not using it - key information for this section: effect on other benefits, appeals and edge cases - also more information on how things are worked out</li>
        </ul>
