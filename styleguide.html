        <h1>How we write</h1>
        <div class="outline">
          <p>GOV.UK content principles can be boiled down to tone of voice and brevity. Content is focussed on user demand. We give people the information they want upfront and we make sure they find it as quickly as possible.</p>
       </div>
        <h2>Tone of voice</h2>
        <p>We speak to the user. Our tone is:
        <li>serious but not pompous</li>
        <li>pared back</li>
        <li>in the vernacular ;-)</li>
        <li>active and engaging</li>
        <li>trustworthy and official</li>
        <li>definitive and authoratitive</li>
        <li>incisive but human</li>
        <li>brisk but not terse</li>
        <li>brief, succinct and to the point</li>
        </p>
       
        <h2>Brevity</h2>
        <p>Writing concisely, free of jargon, plain english, contractiosn, no caveats, no unwieldy grammar, taking risks?</p> 
        

    <li class="principle">
       <article>
        <h1>Content design</h1>
        <h2>Guides</h2>
        <p>'Part 1' of the guide should contain the most important information that the majority of users will want to read - can be an 'overview' but this is not obligatory.</p>
        <p>Following chapters should contain more specific information as well as content for niche audiences.</p>

        <h3>Chapters</h3>
        <p>You should break content into chapters based on user needs as well as the natural structure of the content.</p>
        <p>It is not compulsory to use chapters. If you find that you only have 3 or 4 small chapters in a guide, consider simply having a page without chapters which users can scroll.</p>

        <h3>Chapter titles </h3>
        <p>To ensure consistency across the site, the following chapter titles (and where possible order) should be standard:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Overview</li>
          <li>Eligibility</li>
          <li>Apply for...</li>
          <li>Appeal against...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other things to consider:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Don't force a linear reading pattern</li>
          <li>Don't duplicate information but also don't assume people have read all parts of the guide</li>
          <li>You can link between different parts of the guide using slugs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Answers</h2>
        <p>Answers assume prior knowledge and answer a popular - and specific - need (so you do not need to explain terms or provide context). For example, the answer 'National Minimum Wage rate' should only give the rate, not information about what the National Minimum Wage is, how to pay it, etc. (although you should be clearly linking to related content which does).</p>
        <p>Stick exclusively to the answer - don't be tempted to include extra information, however useful this might appear to be.</p>

        <h3>Structure</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Answer summary - one sentence summing up the answer for common case - get the basic information in this summary - not an introduction - use summary tags</li>

          <li>Body - expand on summary with any necessary detail - be strict with information you include - don't stray off topic - stick to task - light touch on words even if this means compromising caveats - no need to repeat info in subhead</li>

          <li>Subheads - as close to search terms as possible - No need for the 'if' (eg 'You're working abroad') - H2 are primary subs</li>

          <li>Formatting - don't break up text with too many subheads - use formatting options (eg callouts) but not gratuitously - use accessibility formatting</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When does an answer become a guide?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>When the answer can't be simplified - eg too many variables - such as 'What hours your child can work' - for this, the answer depends on too many things, such as the age of your child and the type of job</li>

          <li>When it can't be summed up</li>

          <li>When it's low popularity search - it can form part of a longer guide so it doesn't clog up the results page</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Benefits and schemes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Overview - give people the main things they want to know without going into detail - eg rate and how long it's paid for - separate out key points (not one long paragraph)</li>

          <li>Main sections - stick to the title / need - resist temptation to provide information around the subject (especially superfluous advice) - use examples for complex calculations (use example markdown) - stick to common case - any edge cases get put in 'Further information'</li>

          <li>Further information - this isn't a dumping ground - content still needs to be useful - if you can't find a place for it, suggest not using it - key information for this section: effect on other benefits, appeals and edge cases - also more information on how things are worked out</li>
        </ul>

        
    </li>
