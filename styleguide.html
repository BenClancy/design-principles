        <h1>Style guide: GOV.UK</h1>
        <div class="outline">
          <p>This style guide is for written content on the GOV.UK website. </p>
        </div>
          <p>The first part of this guide is for the whole of GOV.UK. It covers the basics: how to handle legal language, capitalisation etc. This gives us a consistent feel, whether you are in the news section of Inside Government or a quick answer on child benefits rates.</p>
          <p>Then there are separate sections for the &lsquo;mainstream&rsquo; content (this is content for both businesses and citizens) and Inside Government content. These go over the different formats (eg the way we present the information) and go into more detail on specifics.</p>
        <h2>Ever&#45;changing style guide</h2>
          <p>This style guide will evolve &ndash; check <a href="https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples">www.gov.uk/designprinciples</a> for the up-to-date version.</p>

        <h1>Tone</h1>
        <p>GOV.UK is for everyone in the UK and those outside the UK who have an interest in how government policies affect them. It has a welcoming and reassuring tone and aims to be a trusted and familiar resource.</p>
      </p>
        
          <p>If there are style differences for separate sections of the site, you will see  a &lsquo;Style differences&rsquo; heading under the main content; if not, this style is to be used across the whole of GOV.UK.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Addressing the user</h2>
        <p>Users benefit from simple, direct language. Address the user as &lsquo;you&rsquo; where possible. Content on the site often makes a direct appeal to citizens and businesses to get involved or take action, eg: &lsquo;You can contact <abbr title="HM Revenue & Customs">HMRC</abbr> by phone and email&rsquo; or &lsquo;Pay your car tax.&rsquo;</p>
        <h2>Style differences</h2>
        <p>Mainstream: Don&rsquo;t use &lsquo;we&rsquo;, &lsquo;I&rsquo;, &lsquo;our&rsquo;, &lsquo;us&rsquo;.<br />
        Inside Government: Use &lsquo;we&rsquo; if the &lsquo;we&rsquo; is obvious from the context, eg it&rsquo;s clearly a department or the government.</p>
        <h2>Using plain English</h2>
        <p>Use plain English &ndash; don&rsquo;t use complicated or long words when easy or short ones will do &ndash; use &lsquo;buy&rsquo;  instead of &lsquo;purchase&rsquo;, &lsquo;help&rsquo;  instead of &lsquo;assist&rsquo;, &lsquo;about&rsquo;  instead of &lsquo;approximately&rsquo;  and &lsquo;like&rsquo;  instead of &lsquo;such as&rsquo;.</p>
        <p>Write content as simply as possible so that it is usable and accessible to everyone in the UK, regardless of their language and vocabulary skills.</p>
        <p>Write conversationally &ndash; picture your audience and write as if you were talking to them one-to-one but with the authority of someone who can actively assist.</p>
       
        <p>Please note: use of plain English is mandatory for all sections of the site &ndash; all audiences should understand our content; this isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;dumbing down&rsquo;, this is opening up government information to all.</p>
        <h2>Jargon</h2>
        <p>Avoid unnecessary jargon, legalistic prose, unexplained abbreviations or acronyms, rarely used Latin terms (inter alia, ad hoc, ibid) etc.</p>
        <h2>Style differences</h2>
        <p><a href="#ig">Inside Government has additional information</a> about how to handle jargon</p>
        <h2>Active voice</h2>
        <p>Use the active rather than passive voice. This will help us write concise, engaging content.</p>
        <h2>Gender neutral text</h2>
        <p>Make sure text is gender neutral wherever possible.</p>
        <h2>Be concise</h2>
        <p>To keep content understandable, concise and relevant, it should be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>informative</li>
          <li>clear and concise</li>
          <li>brisk but not terse</li>
          <li>incisive (friendliness can lead to a lack of precision and unnecessary words) &ndash; but remain human (not a faceless machine)</li>
          <li>serious but not pompous</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You should:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>use contractions (eg can&rsquo;t)</li>
          <li>not let caveats dictate unwieldy grammar &ndash; eg say &lsquo;You can&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;You may be able to&rsquo;</li>
          <li>use the language people are using &ndash; use Google Insights to check for terms people search for</li>
          <li>not use long sentences with complicated sub-clauses</li>
        </ul>
      </article>
    </li>
    <li class="principle">
      <article>
        <h1>Points of style</h1>
        <h2>Abbreviations and acronyms</h2>
        <p>Spell out acronyms at first mention unless they&rsquo;re well known, eg UK, DVLA, US, EU, VAT, MP etc.</p>
        <p>The first time you use an abbreviation or acronym, explain it in full on each page, and then refer to it by initials. For example &ndash; HM Revenue &amp; Customs (<abbr title="HM Revenue &amp; Customs">HMRC</abbr>). Don&rsquo;t use an acronym if you&rsquo;re not going to use it again later in the text.</p>
        <p>Quick reminder: Freedom of Information &ndash; you can make an <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> request but not a request under the <abbr title="Freedom of Information">FOI</abbr> Act.</p>
        <p>Acronyms that are used as words, eg NATO, AIDS still take capitalisation.</p>
        <p>Don&rsquo;t use full stops in abbreviations - BBC, not B.B.C.</p>
        <h2>Americanisms</h2>
        <p>Organise &ndash; not organize. Exceptions include where it&rsquo;s part of a specific name, eg &lsquo;4th Mechanized Brigade&rsquo;.</p>
        <p>You &lsquo;fill in&rsquo; a form, not &lsquo;fill out&rsquo; a form.</p>
        <h2>Ampersand</h2>
        <p>Use &lsquo;and&rsquo; rather than an &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; unless as part of a brand name, eg HM Revenue &amp; Customs, Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office.</p>
        <h2>Brackets</h2>
        <p>Use (round brackets), not [square brackets]. The only acceptable use of square brackets is for explanatory notes in reported speech. Eg a minister&rsquo;s speech on Inside Government:<br />
        <p>&ldquo;Thank you [Foreign Minister] Mr Smith.&rdquo;</p>
        <h2>Bullet points</h2>
        <p>How to use bullet points to make text easier to read:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>if you&rsquo;re tempted to put a bold header in a bullet, try breaking the list into subheads instead</li>
          <li>always use a lead-in sentence</li>
          <li>use lower-case at the start of the bullet</li>
          <li>don&rsquo;t use full stops within bullet points &ndash; where possible start another bullet point or use commas, dashes or semi&#45;colons to expand on an item</li>
          <li>do not put &lsquo;or&rsquo;, &lsquo;and&rsquo; after the bullets</li>
          <li>there should be no full stop after a bullet point</li>
          <li>bullets should always make sense running on from the lead-in sentence</li>
          <li>don&rsquo;t use numbered bullets &ndash; there is a steps format</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Capitalisation</h2>
        <p>DON&rsquo;T USE BLOCK CAPITALS FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF TEXT AS IT&rsquo;S QUITE HARD TO READ.</p>
        <p>Lower case is preferable but capitalisation should be used for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>departments (specific ones)</li>
          <li>titles</li>
          <li>buildings</li>
          <li>place names</li>
          <li>brand names</li>
          <li>The Earth (ie our planet), Planet Earth and Earth sciences</li>
          <li>faculties, departments, institutes and schools</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For government agencies, funding bodies and other organisations, use initial capitals where indicated by the agency, eg, Natural Environmental Research Council</p>
        <p>Lowercase should be used for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>government, never Government</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For government-related caps, see the <a href="#ig"> Inside Government style guide</a>.</p>
        <p>Each section of the site has a detailed capitalisation convention: please refer to individual style guides.</p>
        <h2>Dates and times</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>tax year 2011 to 2012</li>
        <li>5:30pm (not 1730hrs)</li>
        <li>Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm</li>
        <li>10 November to 21 December</li>
        <li>10am to 11am (not 10&ndash;11am)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When referring to &lsquo;today&rsquo; (eg in a news article) make sure you include the date as well. For example: &ldquo;The minister announced today (14 June, 2012) that&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
        <h2>Eg, etc, and ie</h2>
        <p>Don&rsquo;t use full stops after or between these notations. This was once necessary when print setting but is now cumbersome to read with modern documents and digital screens.</p>
        <p>If you feel the long form is required (&lsquo;for example&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;eg&rsquo;, &lsquo;specifically&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;ie&rsquo; etc) then this is at the content designer&rsquo;s discretion. User testing has shown that some people are not familiar with abbreviations such as eg, so consider your audience before abbreviating.</p>
        <h2>Email addresses</h2>
        <p>An email address should be written out in full and always linked. Don&rsquo;t include any other words as part of the link.</p>
        <h2>Geography/regions</h2>
        <p>Compass directions are all in lowercase: the north, the south of England, the south-west, north-east Scotland, south Wales.</p>
        <p>The same applies to geopolitical regions: the west, western Europe, the far east, south-east Asia.</p>
        <p>Note the following: East End, West End (London), Middle East, Central America, North America, South America, Latin America.</p>
        <p>You can use a capital for a shortened version of a specific area or region if it&rsquo;s commonly known by that name, eg &lsquo;the Gulf&rsquo; for the Persian Gulf. If it&rsquo;s not in common use in the media etc, stick with lowercase eg &lsquo;the strait&rsquo; for &lsquo;the Strait of Hormuz&rsquo;.</p>
        <h2>Great Britain</h2>
        <p>Refers only to England, Wales and Scotland, excluding Northern Ireland.</p>
        <h2>Britain</h2>
        <p>Short for &lsquo;the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&rsquo;. &lsquo;Britain&rsquo; and &lsquo;British&rsquo; are synonymous with United Kingdom.</p>
        <p>Use UK and United Kingdom in preference to Britain and British (UK business, UK foreign policy, ambassador and high commissioner). Note &ndash; British embassy, not UK embassy.</p>
        <h2>Hyphenation</h2>
        <p>Hyphenated:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>re + word starting with &lsquo;e&rsquo; eg re&ndash;elect</li>
          <li>co-ordinate</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Non-hyphenated:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>reuse</li>
          <li>reorder</li>
          <li>reopen</li>
          <li>email</li>
          <li>jpeg (and other common technology words)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In general, if in doubt, don&rsquo;t use a hyphen unless the sense is ambiguous without it and check the Oxford English Dictionary for Writers and Editors.</p>
        <h2>Italics</h2>
        <p>Don&rsquo;t use italics. Use &lsquo;single quotation marks&rsquo; if referring to a document, scheme or initiative.</p>
        <h2>Legal language</h2>
        <p>If you are referring to something that is a legal requirement, use: &lsquo;must&rsquo;, for example: your employer must pay you the National Minimum Wage (<abbr title="National Minimum Wage">NMW</abbr>).</p>
        <p>If you feel that &lsquo;must&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t provide enough emphasis, then use: &lsquo;legal requirement / legally entitled&rsquo; etc&hellip; &lsquo;Once your child is registered at school, you are legally responsible for making sure they attend regularly&rsquo;.</p>
        <p>When deciding whether to use &lsquo;must&rsquo; or &lsquo;legally entitled&rsquo; etc&hellip; consider how important it is for us to talk about the legal aspect, as well as the overall tone of voice.</p>
        <p>If a requirement is legal, but administrative, or part of a process that won&rsquo;t have criminal repercussions, then use: &lsquo;need to&rsquo;, for example: &lsquo;You will need to provide copies of your marriage certificate&rsquo;.</p>
        <p>This may be a legal requirement, but not completing it would simply prevent the individual from moving on to the next stage of a process, rather than committing a more serious offence, like not paying employees the National Minimum Wage.</p>
        <h2>Links</h2>
        <p>Frontload and <strong>always link to online services first.</strong> Offer offline alternatives afterwards (where possible).</p>
        <h2>Measurements</h2>
        <p>Use numerals and spell out measurements at first mention:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>4 metres squared</li>
          <li>10 kilograms (except in tables where abbreviations can be used to save space but use markdown)</li>
        </ul>
        <P>Abbreviating kilograms to kg is acceptable after first use but use acronym markdown.</P>
        <P>If the measurement is more than one word, eg &lsquo;kilometres per hour&rsquo; then spell it out the first time it is used with the abbreviation. From then on, abbreviate. If it is only mentioned once, don&rsquo;t abbreviate.</P>
        <p>Use Celsius for temperature, eg 37&deg;C.</P>
        <h2>Numbers</h2>
        <p>Write <strong>all</strong> numbers in numerics (including 1 to 9) except where it&rsquo;s part of a common expression and it would look strange, eg &lsquo;one or two of them&rsquo;. Use common sense:</p>
        <p>One of the 13 words in this sentence is causing problems: this 1.</p>
        <p>This sentence would be better with &lsquo;one&rsquo; as the final word. If a number starts a sentence, write it out in full &lsquo;Thirty&ndash;four hula&ndash;hoops found in researcher&rsquo;s filing cupboard&rsquo; except where it starts a heading.</p>
        <p>For numerals over 999 &ndash; insert a comma for clarity. &lsquo;It was over 9,000&rsquo; Spell out common fractions, such as one&ndash;half, but use a % sign for percentages, so 50%.</p>
        <p>Use &lsquo;500 to 900&rsquo; and not &lsquo;500&ndash;900&rsquo;.</p>
        <h2>Millions</h2>
        <p>Always use  million in money (and billion), eg &pound;138 million. Use millions in phrases eg &ldquo;millions of people&rdquo;.</p>
        <h2>Money</h2>
        <p>Use the &pound; symbol &ndash; &pound;75</p>
        <p>Don&rsquo;t use decimals unless pence are included &ndash; for example use: &pound;75.50 but not &pound;75.00.</p>
        <p>Don&rsquo;t use &lsquo;&pound;0.xxm&rsquo; for less than &pound;1 million.</p>
        <p>Write out &lsquo;pence&rsquo; in full &ndash; &lsquo;calls will cost 4 pence per minute from a landline&rsquo;.</p>
        <h2>Quotes and speech marks</h2>
        <p>In long passages of speech, open quotes for every new paragraph, but close quotes only at the end of the final paragraph.</p>
        <h2>Single quotes</h2>
        <p>Use single quotes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>in headlines</li>
          <li>links</li>
          <li>unusual terms</li>
          <li>when referring to words or publications eg: Download the publication &lsquo;Understanding Capital Gains Tax&rsquo; (PDF 360KB)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Double quotes</h2>
        <p>Double quotes in body text for direct quotations.</p>
        <h2>Block quotes</h2>
        <p>Use the block quote markdown for quotes longer than a few sentences.</p>
        <h2>Singular, plural and contractions</h2>
        <p>Use contractions eg &lsquo;they&rsquo;ve&rsquo;, &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll&rsquo;. Avoid using &lsquo;should&rsquo;ve&rsquo;, &lsquo;could&rsquo;ve&rsquo;, &lsquo;would&rsquo;ve&rsquo; etc &ndash; these are hard to read.</p>
        <h2>Organisations</h2>
        <p>All organisations are singular. For example, &lsquo;the government has decided to sell assets&rsquo;.</p>
        <h2>Search engine optimisation</h2>
        <p>Title key points:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>keep it short &ndash; 8 words will appear in search so think about which 8 words are going to best convey your information</li>
          <li>remember you are on a single domain with large cross-overs of content</li>
          <li>concise &ndash; avoid stop words like of, in, at, for, and - search engines simply ignore these terms so if you use them, make sure they are not taking up space of a keyword (but make sure it makes sense)</li>
          <li>frontload keywords</li>
          <li>include variations/abbreviations if they are popular in search</li>
          <li>how will they appear in search results? Should be specific so can differentiate from other titles, and make sense in isolation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Meta description key points:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>don&rsquo;t just repeat the title &ndash; meta descriptions should cover the scope of the content item and sell it to the intended audience</li>
          <li>include popular keywords found with keyword tools </li>
          <li>descriptions can get rid of ambiguity if titles are similar</li>
          <li>optimal length for meta descriptions is around 150 characters</li>
          <li>use dashes and commas</li>
          <li>don&rsquo;t use full stops</li>
          <li>define terms used in title if they're not popular in search</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Spaces</h2>
        <p>Use only 1 space after a full stop, not 2.</p>
        <h2>Telephone numbers</h2>
        <p>Use &lsquo;Telephone: 011 111 111&rsquo; or &lsquo;Mobile:&rsquo; not &lsquo;Mob:&rsquo;.</p>
        <p>Use spaces between city and local exchange etc. Here are the different formats to use:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>01273 800 900</li>
          <li>020 7450 4000</li>
          <li>0800 890 567</li>
          <li>07771 900 900</li>
          <li>077718 300 300</li>
          <li>+44 (0)20 7450 4000</li>
          <li>+39 1 33 45 70 90</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When a number has been chosen to be memorable, group the numbers into easily remembered units, eg 0800 80 70 60.</p>
        <h2>Titles</h2>
        <p>Remember all the search engine optimisation points and use colons to introduce the sub clause.</p>
        <p>Good example:<br />
        Income Tax reform: impact assessment<br />
        Bad example:<br />
        An assessment of the impact of proposed reforms to Income Tax</p>
        <h2>Transactions / services</h2>
        <p>These are pre-transaction pages. Use <abbr title="Search Engine Optimisation">SEO</abbr> to define the title, so if people search for &lsquo;registry office&rsquo;, put that in and then explain the proper term is &lsquo;register office&rsquo;.</p>
        <p>Give one sentence of what the user can expect from the service &ndash; this will appear before the button.</p>
        <p><strong>&lsquo;What you need to know&rsquo; section </strong> <br />
        This is where you put information that the user will need to complete the transaction and information about how long it takes, how much there will be to pay etc.</p>
        <p>You can add alternatives to the online transaction at the bottom of the page.</p>

        <h1>Style differences: Mainstream<br />(citizen/business)</h1>
        <div class="outline">
          <p>This is a guide to style and conventions for the mainstream parts of GOV.UK (content and tools for citizens and businesses).This style guide is complementary to the GOV.UK style guide. Make sure you check <a href="https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples">www.gov.uk/designprinciples</a> for the up-to-date version.
         <p>Users are more task-driven on mainstream GOV.UK. Make sure you keep the action of the task firmly in mind.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Formats</h2>
        <p>&lsquo;Formats&rsquo; is the term we use to define the different ways of presenting information, for example: guides have multiple pages of information around a topic, answers give a single, concise answer etc.</p>
        <h2>Guides</h2>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>&lsquo;Part 1&rsquo; of the guide should contain the most important information that the majority of users will want to read &ndash; you can have an &lsquo;overview&rsquo; but you don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
        <p>Following chapters should contain more specific information as well as content for niche audiences.</p>
        <h2>Chapters</h2>
        <p>You should break content into chapters based on user needs as well as the natural structure of the content.</p>
        <p>You don&rsquo;t have to use chapters. If you find that you only have 3 or 4 small chapters in a guide, consider simply having a page without chapters where users can scroll.</p>
        <h2>Chapter titles</h2>
        <p>For consistency across the site, the following chapter titles (and where possible, order) should be standard:</p>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Eligibility</li>
        <li>Apply for...</li>
       <li> Appeal against...</li>
       <p>Don't force a linear reading pattern.</p>
        <br> Don't duplicate information but also don't assume people have read all parts of the guide.<br />
        You can link between different parts of the guide using slugs.</p>
        <h2>Answers</h2>
        <p>Answers assume prior knowledge and answer a popular &ndash; and specific &ndash; need (so you don&rsquo;t need to explain terms or provide context). For example, the answer &lsquo;National Minimum Wage rate&rsquo; should only give the rate, not information about what the National Minimum Wage is, how to pay it, etc (although you should be clearly linking to related content that does).</p>
        <p>Stick exclusively to the answer &ndash; don&rsquo;t be tempted to include extra information, however useful this might appear to be.</p>
        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <p>Answer summary</p>

          <li>as close to search terms as possible</li>
          <li>avoid questions &ndash; use statements

          <li>use accessibility formatting</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>When does an answer become a guide?</h2>
        <p>When the answer:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>can&rsquo;t be simplified &ndash; eg too many variables &ndash; such as &lsquo;What hours your child can work&rsquo;</li>
          <li>depends on too many things, such as the age of your child and the type of job</li>
          <li>can&rsquo;t be summed up</li>
          <li>is low popularity search &ndash; it can form part of a longer guide so it doesn&rsquo;t clog up the results page</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Benefits and schemes</h2>
        <p>Overview</p>
        <ul>
          <li>give people the main things they want to know without going into detail &ndash; eg rate and how long it&rsquo;s paid for</li>
          <li>separate main points (not one long paragraph)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Main sections</p>
        <ul>
          <li>stick to the title/need</li>

          <li>use examples for complex calculations (use example markdown)</li>
          <li>stick to common case &ndash; any edge cases get put in &lsquo;Further information&rsquo;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Further information</p>
        <ul>
          <li>this isn&rsquo;t a dumping ground &ndash; content still needs to be useful &ndash; if you can't find a place for it, don&rsquo;t use it</li>

                <div class="caption">
                  <h3>Acronyms</h3>
                    <p>Common acronyms don&rsquo;t need markdown (eg VAT, UK, US, EU, MP). Don&rsquo;t use acronyms if you&rsquo;re not going to use the acronym later in the text.</p>
                    <p>Acronyms that are used as words eg NATO, AIDS still take capitalisation.</p>
                    <h3>Addressing the user</h3>
                    <p>Always address the user as &lsquo;you&rsquo; and don&rsquo;t use &lsquo;we&rsquo;, &lsquo;I&rsquo;, &lsquo;our&rsquo;, &lsquo;us&rsquo;.</p>
                    <h3>Bullets</h3>
                    <p>This is how to do bullets:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>have a lead-in sentence</li>
                      <li>don&rsquo;t end with &lsquo;and&rsquo;, &lsquo;or&rsquo; or a semicolon</li>
                      <li>don&rsquo;t use sentences within a bullet point &ndash; dashes, semicolons etc are okay</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Capitalisation</h3>
                    <p>Capitalise:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>names of government schemes eg Right to Buy, Queen&rsquo;s Awards for Enterprise</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Don&rsquo;t capitalise:</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>government (unless part of a name)</li>
                      <li>the titles of publications. Use an initial cap only. Eg &lsquo;Implementing self-financing for council housing&rsquo; (unless it includes a phrase which should be capitalised for other reasons eg &lsquo;Review of the Right to Buy scheme&rsquo;).</li>
                      <li>seasons eg summer</li>
                      <li>compass directions eg the south of England</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Contractions</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Use as much as possible (they&rsquo;ll, you&rsquo;ll etc)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Dates and times</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>6 September 1976</li>
                      <li>tax year 2011 to 2012</li>
                      <li>5:30pm and 11am (not 1730hrs)</li>
                      <li>Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm</li>
                      <li>10 November to 21 December</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Eg, etc and ie</h3>
                    <p>Don&rsquo;t use full stops between or after these notations.</p>
                    <h3>Email addresses</h3>
                    <p>Always write in full (and as a hyperlink in markdown).</p>
                    <h3>Legal language</h3>
                    <p>If it is a legal requirement, use &lsquo;must&rsquo;.<br />
                    <p>If this doesn&rsquo;t provide enough emphasis, use &lsquo;legal requirement&rsquo;.</p>
                    <h3>Links</h3>
                    <p>Always link to online services first. Link to offline services after (where possible).<br />
                    Use external markdown where necessary.</p>
                    <h3>Links to documents:</h3>
                    <p>Download &lsquo;This is the document title&rsquo; (PDF, 69KB)<br />
                    Check all links on preview before publishing. Make sure link text is helpful (eg not &lsquo;click here&rsquo;).</p>
                    <h3>Lists</h3>
                    <p>Use bullets for more than a couple of items. If doing a list in a sentence, use commas to separate items, not semicolons.</p>
                    <h3>Measurements</h3>
                    <p>Use numerals and spell out measurements at first mention eg 10 kilograms.<br />
                    Abbreviate kilograms to kg only after it is first spelt out and use markdown. </p>
                    <h3>Numbers and money</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>&pound;186 million (not m)</li>
                      <li>&pound;860,000 not &pound;0.86m</li>
                      <li>1,000</li>
                      <li>all numbers are in numerics (including 1&ndash;9)</li>
                      <li>use words with common sense, eg when starting a headline: Thirty-four hula hoops found in researcher&rsquo;s drawer</li>
                      <li>use words for common expressions, eg &ldquo;the minister will be looking at one or two areas&rdquo;</li>

                      <h3>Quotes</h3>
                      <li>use single quotes for unusual terms</li>
                      <li>text emphasis</li>
                      <li>use bold <strong>very</strong> sparingly</li>
                    </ul>

        <h2>About this document</h2>
        <p>This is a guide to style and conventions on Inside Government (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government">www.gov.uk/government</a>). This style guide is complementary to the GOV.UK style guide. Make sure you check <a href="https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples">www.gov.uk/designprinciples</a> for the up-to-date version.</p>
        <p>Users prefer more in-depth information on Inside Government than some of the more task-driven content on mainstream GOV.UK. However, the premise is still to get to the point of the information in a succinct, concise, usable way. There is no space for waffle anywhere on GOV.UK.</p>
        <p>If you are giving your users more detail, you&rsquo;ll need to consider internal links to supporting pages etc more closely. The user journey and architecture within a topic/audience space can become so swamped with detail, it becomes unusable. So there&rsquo;s your challenge.</p>
        <h2>Formats</h2>
        <h2>Policy pages</h2>
        <p>Titles</p>
        <p>Keep them short and active: &ldquo;Responding to x&rdquo; &ndash; use the present continuous.<br />
        Use terms the wider audience will search for &ndash; you can use tools like semrush.com and Google Insights to find out what people are searching for. Don&rsquo;t use &ldquo;The x report&rdquo; unless that search term is higher than the explanation of what &ldquo;The x report&rdquo; says.</p>
        <p>They should make sense if shown under a heading of <strong>&ldquo;What we&rsquo;re doing&rdquo;</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reforming the further education system&hellip;</li>
          <li>Operating&hellip;</li>
          <li>Protecting x from y&hellip;</li>
          <li>Preventing&hellip;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Good example:<br />
        &lsquo;Setting up a national careers service&rsquo;<br />
        &lsquo;Reforming higher education and student finance&rsquo;</p>
        <p>Bad example:<br />
        &lsquo;Charter for business&rsquo;</p>
        <h2>Issue (mandatory)</h2>
        <p>Keep this a concrete problem or opportunity. It&rsquo;s not about the history or what led to this particular policy being implemented, but a description of what it&rsquo;s trying to remedy or improve. Information about history, development and contextual matters should go into &lsquo;Background&rsquo;. Convey what will happen if the government doesn&rsquo;t take action.</p>
        <p>The issue should not contain any statement of the government&rsquo;s actions or intended actions &ndash; that should go into the actions.</p>
        <p>Example<br />
        The public sector &ndash; including central government, local councils and devolved administrations &ndash; accounts for around 3% of the UK&rsquo;s carbon emissions. In England alone, the government spends &pound;2.5 billion on building energy and &pound;1.2 billion on owned-vehicle fuel.</p>
        <p>Improving energy efficiency in the public sector will result in a better use of taxpayers&rsquo; money and help the UK meet existing climate change agreements.</p>
        <h2>Actions (mandatory)</h2>
        <p>Keep the actions to what we are doing now or next. Previous actions can go into background.</p>
        <p>Example<br />
        To reduce our environmental impact, by 2015 the government will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% from the whole estate and business&ndash;related transport</li>
          <li>reduce the amount of waste generated (eg by recycling paper and <abbr title="information and communications technology">ICT</abbr>  equipment) by 25%</li>
          <li>reduce water consumption and report on office water use</li>
          <li>ensure goods, services and suppliers chosen by the government are energy efficient</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If an &lsquo;action&rsquo; was conducted in the past but the effects of that action are still being felt (eg the benefits of successfully lobbying the EU), then it is considered to still be current.</p>
        <p>If an action was conducted, and then superseded by related and further action, policy, etc, then it&rsquo;s considered &lsquo;background&rsquo;.</p>
        <h2>Background (mandatory)</h2>
        <p>This isn&rsquo;t a dumping ground for information that doesn&rsquo;t fit the other headings, nor a history of everything, but a clear indication of how the policy got to where it is.</p>
        <p>Example<br />
        Issue: Around half of all crime is committed by people who have already been through the criminal justice system. The cost to the taxpayer of reoffending is estimated to be &pound;7 billion to &pound;10 billion per year.</p>
        <p>Actions: We will continue to punish offenders but we will also help them turn their lives around, reducing reoffending and making our communities safer. We will achieve this by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>supporting offenders to resettle in their communities, find work and stop committing offences</li>
          <li>using &lsquo;payment by results&rsquo; pilot programmes to develop innovative ways of rehabilitating offenders and ensuring we only put taxpayers&rsquo; money into the programmes that work</li>
          <li>encouraging greater use of community-based punishments so that fewer prisoners are being held</li>
          <li>providing meaningful work and training for prisoners</li>
          <li>preventing drug abuse inside prisons and providing support for offenders after their release or when they&rsquo;re serving a community sentence</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Background: Punishment is an essential part of the justice system, but on its own it doesn&rsquo;t stop people reoffending. Almost half of all adults leaving prison are reconvicted within a year &ndash; and for those serving short sentences, the figure is even higher. The same criminals repeatedly pass through the courts, prison and community sentences, creating new victims of crime and extra costs to society.</p>
        <p>To cut crime, we need to be far more successful at getting offenders to go straight after serving their sentences.</p>
        <p>Prisons and community sentences will be judged on how effectively they stop their reoffending. Similarly, independent providers (private companies, charities or not-for-profit organisations) will be paid according to their level of success in rehabilitating offenders. They will address the roots of criminality, in areas such as drug and alcohol addiction, mental illness and skills shortages.</p>
        <br>While only the issue, actions and background headings are mandatory, please try to populate the following fields.</br>
        <h2>Engagement (optional)</h2>
        <p>Explain who has been or will be consulted, and in what way. List any consultations &ndash; formal or informal. Give some detail about what is being done and by whom, don&rsquo;t just add a list of links.</p>
        <p>Example<br />
        The government ran a consultation on &lsquo;Breaking the cycle: effective punishment, rehabilitation and sentencing of offenders&rsquo;. These are the proposals for effectively punishing and rehabilitating offenders and reforming sentencing.</p>
        <h2>Impact (optional)</h2>
        <p>Say who benefits from, or is otherwise affected by, the policy. Mention (and link inline) to any impact assessment publications.</p>
        <h2>Bills and legislation (optional)</h2>
        <p>Give details of the relevant legislative framework (the legal context in which this policy is operating) and if the policy will mean changes to the law. Write full sentences, not just a list of related laws, and add links where relevant.</p>
        <h2>Partner organisations (optional)</h2>
        <p>Detail the organisations which have a major involvement, and what work is being done by them or with them &ndash; write full sentences, don&rsquo;t just list the organisations.</p>
        <h2>News and speeches, publications, consultations (optional)</h2>
        <p>Links to relevant formal consultations will appear automatically based on associations (from a consultation/news article/publication etc to a policy).</p>
        <p>Tip: If there&rsquo;s nothing substantial to write under Issue and Actions, you might be looking at material for a policy detail page rather than a policy definition page.</p>
        <h2>Policy detail (supporting) pages</h2>
        <p>These don&rsquo;t have mandatory headings but are used to provide supporting detail, eg an explanation of a scheme that&rsquo;s part of a policy, or additional context about an issue.</p>
        <h2>Publications</h2>
        <h2>Titles</h2>
        <p>Titles don&rsquo;t have to reflect the &lsquo;official&rsquo; publication title. Keep them short and search- and user-friendly.<br />
        Front-load all titles &ndash; get all the most important words at the front of the sentence.</p>
        <p>Good example:<br />
        Income Tax reform: impact assessment<br />
        <p>Bad example:<br />
        An assessment of the impact of proposed reforms to Income Tax</p>
        <p>You can mention the report title etc in the summary or page copy if you think users will search for that term.</p>
        <p>Good example:<br />
        &lsquo;Improving government online services&rsquo;</p>
        <p>Bad example:<br />
        &lsquo;The Varney report&rsquo;</p>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>This will be seen on section pages &ndash; not the publication page itself so <strong>don&rsquo;t use it for essential information</strong> unless that information is repeated in the body text. It&rsquo;s a short, snappy overview and takes a full stop.</p>
        <p>Write a 140 character summary &ndash; this will help with concise writing for search etc.</p>
        <h2>Body text &ndash; what it&rsquo;s for</h2>
        <p>The body of a publication page is used to provide a summary of the publication in plain, neutral language &ndash; to reassure the user that it is (or isn&rsquo;t) what they&rsquo;re looking for. Include what the publication is about and its purpose. Publications often outlive governments so keep the language politically neutral.</p>
        <p>Good example:<br/>
        These reports describe the effect of government proposals to reduce the amount of money spent on legal aid. The aim of the reforms is to make sure legal aid is still available for support and representation in cases where it is justified.</p>
        <h2>Attachments &ndash; title field</h2>
        <p>Use the official title of the document.</p>
        <h2>Things to check</h2>
        <p>Check the following have been populated:</p>

        <h2>Speeches</h2>
        <p>In the &lsquo;type&rsquo; dropdown, select:<br />
       <ul>
       <li> Transcript &ndash; only for verbatim reports of exactly what the speaker said, NOT &lsquo;check against delivery&rsquo;</li>
        <li> Draft &ndash; for what the speaker was supposed to say (&lsquo;check against delivery&rsquo;, though this is not necessary to state in the text)</li>
        <li> Speaking notes &ndash; if it is not a complete speech, eg a list of topics, cue cards</li>
        <li> Written statement &ndash; a written statement submitted to the House, a letter to newspaper etc</li>
        <li> Oral statement &ndash; often a statement to the House or a briefing to camera</li></p>
        <h2>News format</h2>
        <p>News content directly follows the common style guide, with the exceptions listed below.</p>
        <p>News should not read like a press release &ndash; it should add value to a press release by increasing comprehensibility and user-focus, and removing spin.</p>
        <h2>Titles</h2>
        <p>What is the actual story? Tell it in a few words.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Minister visits factory&rdquo; is not a story. &ldquo;Vince Cable tells factory workers about workplace law reforms&rdquo; gives the reader a sense of what the story is about.</p>
        <p>Avoid &lsquo;teasing headlines&rsquo;, puns or wordplay &ndash; these make your story hard for people to find. Use the words most people use for the situation. This helps your search ranking.</p>
        <p>Avoid print conventions / &lsquo;journalese&rsquo; eg &ldquo;Minister in youth homelessness bid&rdquo; (&lsquo;bid&rsquo; is used in print where headline space is in short supply).</p>
        <p>Good example:<br />
        Granny in near-death wolf escape</p>
        <p>Bad example:<br />
        Girl goes into forest, encounters problems</p>
        <h2>Introductions</h2>
        <p>Introductions should be 15 to 50 words. Aim to tell the story in one or two sentences, eg who, what, where, when, why.</p>
        <h2>Body copy</h2>
        <p>Here's how to write effective body copy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the first paragraph of body copy should lead on from the introduction paragraph &ndash; it should not repeat the information</li>
          <li>use &lsquo;inverted pyramid&rsquo; approach with most important information at the top tapering down to lesser detail</li>
          <li>paragraphs should have no more than 5 sentences each</li>
          <li>large blocks of text should be split by regular sub-headers</li>
          <li>ensure copy includes keywords to boost natural search rankings</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Sub-headers</h2>
        <p>For news stories of fewer than than 150 words a sub-header below the introduction is discretionary.</p>
        <h2>Article length</h2>
        <p>No lower limit, although the value of a story under 150 words should be questioned.</p>
        <p>Upper limit of 750 words &ndash; with case-by-case exceptions (eg some Budget pages).</p>
        <h2>Quotes</h2>
        <p>Do not include more than 2 concurrent sentences of quotes unless the quotation/speech is the story.</p>
        <h2>Summaries</h2>
        <p>Summaries end with a full stop.</p>
        <p>Summaries do appear on news stories but not on other content types eg publications.</p>
        <h2>Style points across all formats</h2>
        <h2>Tone of voice</h2>
        <p>The site is aimed at every citizen in the UK, and those outside of the UK with an interest in the UK government, but particularly those with a professional or personal interest in some aspect of government activity (eg an area of policy) or a part of government (eg an organisation or minister).</p>
        <h2>Addressing the user</h2>
        <p>Style differences<br />
        Mainstream: Do not use &lsquo;we&rsquo;, &lsquo;I&rsquo;, &lsquo;our&rsquo;, &lsquo;us&rsquo;.<br />
        Inside Government: Use &lsquo;we&rsquo; if the &lsquo;we&rsquo; is obvious from the context, eg it&rsquo;s clearly a department or the government.</p>
        <h2>Jargon</h2>
        <p>On <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government"> www.GOV.UK/government</a>, sometimes it will be impossible to avoid unusual words or phrases &ndash; but these must be explained where possible. There is no need to explain common terms of reference, eg climate change, but something like The Green Deal does need explaining, or linking to a definition. You can use supporting detail pages to explain complicated background if needed. It&rsquo;s our job to make government understandable to anyone. This includes people with poor literacy skills.</p>
        <p>Try to avoid &lsquo;gov speak&rsquo; and buzzwords, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>collaborate</li>
          <li>dialogue</li>
          <li>disincentivise</li>
          <li>facilitate</li>
          <li>initiate</li>
          <li>leverage</li>
          <li>liaise</li>
          <li>over-arching</li>
          <li>robust</li>
          <li>slimming down</li>
          <li>streamline</li>
          <li>utilise</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Active voice</h2>
        <p>Use the active rather than the passive voice, eg &lsquo;we are doing this&rsquo;, rather than &lsquo;this is being done&rsquo;.</p>
        <h2>Capitalisation</h2>
        <p>Don&rsquo;t capitalise words just because you think they are important. It&rsquo;s hard on the eye and can seem pompous. So don&rsquo;t write, &lsquo;BIS is committed to increasing the number of Apprenticeships.&rsquo;</p>
        <p>Capitalise:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>job titles, ministers&rsquo; role titles eg Minister for Housing, Home Secretary</li>
          <li>names of groups and directorates eg Knowledge and Innovation Group</li>
          <li>Parliament, the House</li>
          <li>an Act or a Bill</li>
          <li>titles of specific Acts or Bills eg Housing Reform Bill</li>
          <li>names of specific, named government schemes known to people outside government eg Right to Buy, Queen&rsquo;s Awards for Enterprise</li>
          <li>specific select committees (eg Public Administration Select Committee)</li>
          <li>acronyms, like NATO or AIDS, use caps</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Don&rsquo;t capitalise:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>government &ndash; never Government, even when referring to the elected administration, unless part of a specific name eg Local Government Association, or Inside Government</li>
          <li>minister, never Minister, unless part of a specific job title eg Minister for the Cabinet Office</li>
          <li>department or ministry &ndash; never Department or Ministry, unless referring to a specific one eg Ministry of Justice</li>
          <li>the titles of publications &ndash; only initial cap on first word and the entire title in single quote marks eg &lsquo;Implementing self&ndash;financing for council housing&rsquo; (unless it includes a phrase which should be capitalised for other reasons eg &lsquo;Review of the Right to Buy scheme&rsquo;)</li>
          <li>white paper, green paper, command paper, House of Commons paper</li>
          <li>director general (note no hyphen), deputy director, director unless in a specific job title</li>
          <li>group and directorate, unless referring to a specific group or directorate eg Commercial Directorate</li>
          <li>departmental board, executive board, the board</li>
          <li>policy themes eg sustainable communities, promoting economic growth, local enterprise zones</li>
          <li>general mention of select committees (but DO cap specific ones &ndash; see above)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>DON&rsquo;T USE BLOCK CAPITALS FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF TEXT AS IT&rsquo;S QUITE HARD TO READ.</p>
        <h2>Images</h2>
        <p>Ask yourself what purpose the image will convey. If it is a picture of a key when talking about online services &ndash; this is probably not that useful. If you use a picture of a new state-of-the-art hospital when it is opened &ndash; this probably is useful.</p>
        <p>Image size for featuring: 1280x684 pixels, 72 dpi</p>
        <h2>Attribution</h2>
        <p>When attributing images, use this format:<br />
        Francis Maude shakes hands with Mark Serwotka. Picture: George Roberts / Crown copyright.</p>
        <h2>Alt text</h2>
        <p>Alt text must be provided where it is necessary for the understanding of visual content. If an image is non-essential to understanding the content, mark it with a *.</p>
        <p>Alt text is used as an alternative to an image for people who use screen readers.</p>
        <p>Example<br />
        Don&rsquo;t tell people there is a logo on the page. However, if there is a picture of a minister in a tank, put an appropriate description.</p>
        <h2>Captions</h2>
        <p>Keep captions under 140 characters including attribution if possible. Exceptions can be made if necessary.</p>
        <h2>Job titles</h2>
        <p>In the first instance, refer to a minister by their commonly known title, eg Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke. After that, refer to them by name only, eg Kenneth Clarke.</p>
        <p>In some instances, such as appointments or official communications, you may have to refer to someone by their full title, eg The Right Honourable Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice Kenneth Clarke.</p>
        <p>Ministers and MPs are given their full titles without the Mr or Mrs &ndash; for example, Prime Minister David Cameron. Use the commonly understood acronym MPs where possible, not Members of Parliament.</p>

                  </ul>
                  <h3>Dates and times</h3>
                  <ul>
                  <li>6 September 1976</li>
                  <li>5:30pm</li>
                  <li>11am (not 1100hrs)</li>
                  <li>Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm</li>
                  <li>10 November to 21 December</li>
                  </ul>
                   <h3>Numbers and money</h3>
                   <ul>
                  <li>&pound;186 million (not m)</li>
                 <li>&pound;860,000 not &pound;0.86 million</li>
                 <li> 1,000</li>
                  <li>Use words with common sense, eg when starting a headline: Thirty-four hula hoops found in researcher&rsquo;s drawer</li>
                  <li>Use words for common expressions, eg &lsquo;the minister will be looking at one or two areas&rsquo;</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>Lists</h3>
                  <p>Use bullets for more than a couple of items. If doing a list in a sentence, use commas to separate items, not semicolons.</p>
                  <h3>Bullets</h3>
                  <p>This is how to do bullets:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>have a lead-in sentence</li>
                    <li>don&rsquo;t end them with &lsquo;and&rsquo;, &lsquo;or&rsquo; or a semicolon</li>
                    <li>don&rsquo;t use sentences within a bullet point &ndash; dashes, semicolons etc are okay</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>Text emphasis</h3>
                  <p>Use bold <strong>very </strong> sparingly. </p>
                  <h3>Quotes</h3>
                  <p>Use single quotes for &lsquo;unusual terms&rsquo;.</p>
                  <p>He said, &ldquo;Short quotes take double quotation marks.&rdquo;</p>
                  <p>She said:</p>
                  <p>&gt; This is a block quote, used for long quotes.<br />
                  &gt;<br />
                  &gt; Don&rsquo;t forget to use the arrow between paragraphs as well.</p>
                  <h3>Acronyms</h3>
                  <p>Common acronyms don&rsquo;t need markdown (eg VAT, UK, US, EU, MP). Don&rsquo;t use acronyms if you&rsquo;re not going to use the acronym later in the text.</p>
                  <p>Tip: for acronyms you use frequently, have a file you can copy/paste.</p>
                  <h3>Links</h3>
                  <p>Use markdown where necessary.</p>
                  <p>Links to documents:<br />
                  Download &lsquo;This is the document title&rsquo; (PDF, 69KB)</p>
                  <p>Check all links on preview before publishing. Make sure link text is helpful, not &lsquo;click here&rsquo;.</p>
                  <h3>Footnotes</h3>
                  <p>Don't use them.</p>
