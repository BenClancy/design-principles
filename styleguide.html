        <h1>Tone of voice</h1>
        <div class="outline">
          <p>The site appeals to every citizen in the UK. It has a welcoming and reassuring tone and aims to be a trusted and familiar resource.</p>
       </div>
        <h2>Addressing the user</h2>
        <p>Users benefit from simple, direct language. Address the user as ‘you’ where possible. Content on the site often makes a direct appeal to citizens to get involved or take action, even if that is an instruction on collecting information, and this requires a shift to a more intimate style, where the use of the second person (“you”) is more immediate and appropriate. “You can contact HMRC by phone and email” or “Pay your car tax.”</p>
        <p>Do not use ‘we’, ‘I’, ‘our’, ‘us’ on the site. The single domain is a communication channel, not the owner of government policies.</p>

        <h2>Use plain English</h2>
        <p>Use plain English – don't use complicated or long words when easy or short ones will do – use ‘buy’ instead of ‘purchase’, ‘about’ instead of ‘approximately’ and ‘like’ instead of ‘such as’. Ensure that content is written as simply as possible so that it is usable and accessible to all citizens, irrespective of their language and vocabulary skills.</p> 
        <p>Write conversationally – picture your audience and write as if you were talking to them one-to-one but with the authority of someone who can actively assist.</p>

        <h2>Active tense</h2>
        <p>Use the active rather than the passive tense. This will help you write concise, engaging content.</p>

        <h2>Jargon</h2>
        <p>Avoid unnecessary jargon, legalistic prose, unexplained abbreviations or acronyms, rarely used Latin terms (inter alia, ad hoc, ibid).</p>

        <h2>Gender neutral text</h2>
        <p>Make sure text is gender neutral wherever possible.</p>

        <h2>Writing concisely</h2>
        <p>In order to keep textual content clean, concise and relevant, it should be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>pared back</li>
          <li>brisk but not terse</li>
          <li>incisive – friendliness leads to fluff – but remain human (not a faceless machine)</li>
          <li>serious but not pompous</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You should:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>use contractions where possible</li>
          <li>don't let caveats dictate unwieldy grammar – eg say 'You can' rather than 'You may be able to'</li>
          <li>use the language people are using – eg sick pay – use Google Insights</li>
          <li>don't use too many clauses</li>
        </ul>
      </article>
    </li>

    <li class="principle">
       <article>
        <h1>Formats</h1>
        <h2>Guides</h2>
        <p>'Part 1' of the guide should contain the most important information that the majority of users will want to read - can be an 'overview' but this is not obligatory.</p>
        <p>Following chapters should contain more specific information as well as content for niche audiences.</p>

        <h3>Chapters</h3>
        <p>You should break content into chapters based on user needs as well as the natural structure of the content.</p>
        <p>It is not compulsory to use chapters. If you find that you only have 3 or 4 small chapters in a guide, consider simply having a page without chapters which users can scroll.</p>

        <h3>Chapter titles </h3>
        <p>To ensure consistency across the site, the following chapter titles (and where possible order) should be standard:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Overview</li>
          <li>Eligibility</li>
          <li>Apply for...</li>
          <li>Appeal against...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other things to consider:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Don't force a linear reading pattern</li>
          <li>Don't duplicate information but also don't assume people have read all parts of the guide</li>
          <li>You can link between different parts of the guide using slugs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Answers</h2>
        <p>Answers assume prior knowledge and answer a popular - and specific - need (so you do not need to explain terms or provide context). For example, the answer 'National Minimum Wage rate' should only give the rate, not information about what the National Minimum Wage is, how to pay it, etc. (although you should be clearly linking to related content which does).</p>
        <p>Stick exclusively to the answer - don't be tempted to include extra information, however useful this might appear to be.</p>

        <h3>Structure</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Answer summary - one sentence summing up the answer for common case - get the basic information in this summary - not an introduction - use summary tags</li>

          <li>Body - expand on summary with any necessary detail - be strict with information you include - don't stray off topic - stick to task - light touch on words even if this means compromising caveats - no need to repeat info in subhead</li>

          <li>Subheads - as close to search terms as possible - No need for the 'if' (eg 'You're working abroad') - H2 are primary subs</li>

          <li>Formatting - don't break up text with too many subheads - use formatting options (eg callouts) but not gratuitously - use accessibility formatting</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When does an answer become a guide?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>When the answer can't be simplified - eg too many variables - such as 'What hours your child can work' - for this, the answer depends on too many things, such as the age of your child and the type of job</li>

          <li>When it can't be summed up</li>

          <li>When it's low popularity search - it can form part of a longer guide so it doesn't clog up the results page</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Benefits and schemes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Overview - give people the main things they want to know without going into detail - eg rate and how long it's paid for - separate out key points (not one long paragraph)</li>

          <li>Main sections - stick to the title / need - resist temptation to provide information around the subject (especially superfluous advice) - use examples for complex calculations (use example markdown) - stick to common case - any edge cases get put in 'Further information'</li>

          <li>Further information - this isn't a dumping ground - content still needs to be useful - if you can't find a place for it, suggest not using it - key information for this section: effect on other benefits, appeals and edge cases - also more information on how things are worked out</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Transactions / services</h2>

        <p>Include the word 'website' in the 'continue on' section.</p>
      </article>
    </li>

    <li class="principle">
       <article>
        <h1>Legal language</h1>
        <h2>Legal requirement</h2>
        <p>If you are referring to something that is a legal requirement, use:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>'must', ie - your employer must pay you the National Minimum Wage (NMW)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you feel that 'must' does not provide enough emphasis, then use:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>'legal requirement / legally entitled' etc... - 'Once your child is registered at school, you are legally responsible for making sure they attend regularly'</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When deciding whether to use 'must' or 'legally entitled' etc...consider how important it is for the legal aspect to be surfaced, as well as the overall tone of voice.</p>

        <p>If a requirement is legal, but administrative in nature, or part of a process that will not have criminal repercussions should an individual not follow them, then use:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>'need to', ie - 'You will need to provide copies of your marriage certificate'</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This may be a legal requirement, but not completing it would simply prevent the individual from moving on to the next stage of a process, rather than committing a more serious offence, such as not paying employees the National Minimum Wage.</p>

        <h2>Guidance</h2>

        <p>When providing guidance, use:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>'should'</li>
        </ul>
      </article>
    </li>

    <li class="principle">
       <article>
        <h1>Points of style</h1>
        <h2>Abbreviations and acronyms</h2>
        <p>The first time you use an abbreviation or acronym, explain it in full, and then you may refer to it by initials. For example - Her Majesty’s Revenue and Custom (HMRC).</p>
        <p>When acronyms are accepted in language and are pronounced as they are written, like Nato or Aids, use initial caps only - if they are not pronounced as they are written, use capitals.</p>
        <p>Some abbreviations are far better known than the full name, in which case use only the abbreviation – eg, UK or VAT.</p>
        <p>Don’t use full stops in abbreviations, it is BBC not B.B.C.</p>

        <h2>Ampersand</h2>
        <p>Use ‘and’ rather than an ‘&’ unless as part of a brand name, ie Bradford & Bingley.</p>

        <h2>Eg, etc, and ie</h2>
        <p>Don’t use full stops after or between these notations. This was once necessary when print setting but is now cumbersome to read with modern documents.</p>
        <p>If you feel the long form is required (‘for example’, ‘specifically’ etc) then this is at the editor’s discretion. User testing has shown that some citizens are not familiar with abbreviations such as eg, so consider your audience before abbreviating.</p>

        <h2>Bullet points</h2>
        <p>Bullet points are a great way to break up dense lists or multiple references. They make a long document more scannable.</p>
        <p>You can use bold in the lead-in sentence to draw attention to key points.</p>

        <p>Remember to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>always use a lead-in sentence</li>
          <li>use lower-case at the start of the bullet</li>
          <li>you can use semi-colons, commas and a dash to split sentences up in a bullet point but don’t use a * full stop - do not use sentences within bullet points; where possible start another bullet point or use * dashes or semi-colons to expand on an item</li>
          <li>do not put ‘or’, ‘and’ after the bullets</li>
          <li>there should be no full stop after a bullet point</li>
          <li>do not put a link between two bullet points</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Singular, plural and contractions</h2>
        <p>Use contractions with discretion, wherever they sound natural depending on the audience for the content.</p>
        <p>It is acceptable to use contractions like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>don’t, didn’t, can’t, won’t, couldn’t, wouldn’t</li>
          <li>it’s, that’s</li>
          <li>you’ll, you’ve, you’re</li>
          <li>they’ll, they’ve</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Avoid using:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>should’ve, could’ve, would’ve</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Singular and plural</h2>
        <p>All organisations are single. For example, ‘the government has decided to sell assets’.</p>

        <h2>Speech marks</h2>
        <p>In long passages of speech, open quotes for every new paragraph, but close quotes only at the end of the final paragraph.</p>

        <h2>Quote marks</h2>
        <p>Single quote marks should be used in headlines, or link headings when referring to words or publications, eg Download the article ‘Understanding Capital Gains Tax’.</p>
        <p>Single quotes should be used when explaining an unfamiliar word or phrase, eg 'your estate' is everything that you own at the time of your death.</p>

        <h2>Hyphenation</h2>
        <p>After ‘re’: only use a hyphen if the word following begins with an e. For example: re-elect. Do not hyphenate reuse; reorder; reopen, etc, but do hyphenate co-ordinate.</p>
        <p>Technology, in particular, lives a short hyphenated life before becoming commonplace and losing its dash. The Wired style guide suggests just cutting to the chase and dropping the hyphen, embracing common use phrases such as email (not e-mail) and jpeg not .JPeg.</p>
        <p>In general, if in doubt, don’t use a hyphen unless the sense is ambiguous without it.</p>
        <p>For reference, use ‘The Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors’.</p>

        <h2>Dates</h2>
        <p>Use the format ‘date month year’ (no commas) - “We will release the Kraken on 27 April 2008”. Only mention the day if required for clarification - for instance, if you usually release the Kraken on Mondays then Tuesday is the differentiating factor.</p>
        <p>Do not use:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>th</li>
          <li>rd</li>
          <li>nd</li>
          <li>st</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So 27 April, not 27th April.</p>
        </article>

        <h2>Times</h2>
        <p>Use the 12 hour clock - hours and minutes separated by colon. If there’s no minutes, contract the times. There is no space between the time and am/pm. For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>5:30pm 11am</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Periods of time</h2>
        <p>They are written as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>8am to 9pm</li>

          <li>Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm</li>

          <li>10 November to 21 December</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Temperatures</h2>
        <p>For common use references, use Celsius. Here’s one for you to copy and paste: 37°C</p>

        <h2>Americanisms</h2>
        <p>It is policy to use ‘ise’ rather than ‘ize’ spellings on the site, which is not in common with the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) but is in common usage throughout academic and research sites based in the UK. organise not organize, pulverise not pulverize.</p>
        <p>Use 'fill in' a form, not 'fill out' a form.</p>

        <h2>Capital letters</h2>
        <p>DON’T USE BLOCK CAPITALS FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF TEXT AS IT IS QUITE HARD TO READ.</p>

        <h2>Italics</h2>
        <p>Don’t use italics on the site. If you need to reference a document or guide, use single quotation marks.</p>

        <h2>Measurements</h2>
        <p>Measurements should be spelled out and have a space between the number and the measurement - for example: 4 metres squared, 10 kilograms (except in tables where abbreviations can be used to save space) use numerals – 4 kilograms not four kilograms if the measurement is more than one word, such as “kilometres per hour” then the standard ‘spell out at first mention’ rule applies - in the first instance it should be spelled out in full with the abbreviation and subsequent mentions to be abbreviated. If it is only mentioned once, there should be no abbreviation</p>

        <h2>Money</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Use the £ symbol - £75</li>

          <li>Do not use £75.00. Only use decimals if pence are included - for example £75.50</li>

          <li>Write out 'pence' in full - 'calls will cost 4 pence per minute from a landline'</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Numbers</h2>
        <p>Write all numbers except 'one' in numerics.</p>
        <p>Millions and billions should be spelt in full.</p>
        <p>If a number starts a sentence, write it out in full ‘Thirty-four hula-hoops found in researcher’s filing cupboard.’ except where it starts a heading.</p>
        <p>For numerals over 999 - insert a comma for clarity. ‘It was over 9,000!’ Spell out common fractions, such as one-half, but use a % sign for percentages, so 50%.</p>

        <h2>Spaces</h2>
        <p>One space after a full stop is now the norm. Ensure there are no double spaces after a full stop.</p>

        <h2>Capitalisation</h2>
        <p>Lower case is preferable but capitalisation should be observed for departments and titles. Proper names for buildings, place names and brand names should be in upper case, as these are proper nouns. Westminster Ministry of Defence Downing Street The Earth (ie our planet) and Earth sciences, Planet Earth government, never Government.</p>

        <h2>Job titles</h2>
        <p>Ministers and MPs are given their full titles without the Mr or Mrs - for example, Prime Minister David Cameron.</p>
        <p>Use lower case when you are describing a role: the head of department research (on a particular project, not a title) a senior researcher in the Foreign Office the Cthulhu hunters (Cthulhu is a proper noun as well as a Great One. Hunters is not.)</p>

        <h2>Faculties, departments, institutes and schools</h2>

        <p>Use upper case:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>from the Foreign Office</li>
          <li>from the Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Dampankle</li>
          <li>contact IT Support</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Telephone numbers</h2>
        <p>Use spaces between city and local exchange etc. Here are the different formats you should use:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>01273 800 900</li>

          <li>020 7450 4000</li>

          <li>020 8678 3456</li>

          <li>0800 890 567</li>

          <li>07771 900 900</li>

          <li>077718 300 300</li>

          <li>+44 (0)20 7450 4000</li>

          <li>077718 300 300</li>

          <li>+39 1 33 45 70 90</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Use ‘mobile’ not ‘mob’ when a number has been chosen to be memorable, group the numbers into easily remembered units, eg the businesslink.gov.uk contact number: 0845 600 9 006; or the Environment Agency Incident Hotline: 0800 80 70 60.</p>
        <p>Use "Telephone: 011 111 111"</p>

        <h2>Government agencies, funding bodies and other organizations</h2>
        <p>Use initial capitals where indicated by the agency, eg, Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC).</p>
        <p>Write government in lower case.</p>
