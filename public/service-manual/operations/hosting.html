  <p>Welcome to the Government Service Design Manual. From April this will be the place to find the digital by default service standard, as well as guidance and tools for building world-class digital services.</p>

  <p>This is an experimental beta version of the manual, and it may contain inaccuracies or have gaps.</p>

  <p>We will be working to improve the site before a full release in April. If you have any feedback please email <a href="mailto:dbdss@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">dbdss@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a></p>

      <p>The software running your service will need servers to run on. This guide will help you decide how you host your applications and the things to think about if selecting a vendor.</p>

<h2 id="deciding-how-to-host-your-application">Deciding how to host your application</h2>

<p>The recommended approach is to involve a small cross-functional group of people. They will quickly access different options, shortlist suppliers, interview  and finally make a descision. This group should include people with a knowledge of the available Procurement options and acceptable costs but must include people with a hands-on technical understanding of the service and underlying software.</p>

<p>It is important to keep good notes from any interviews or deliberation sessions and to access different suppliers equally. A scoring matrix can help here.</p>

<p>It is worth stating that itâ€™s very common to use multiple suppliers. This may be due to them offering different but compatible services or potentially for additional redundancy. This can be technically challenging but for larger projects can provide extra resiliance.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-provider">Types of provider</h2>

<p>There are a number of different approaches taken by suppliers of hosting services, which can make comparing offerings difficult. The following is intended only as a brief introduction.</p>

<p>This advice is complicated because many service providers redefine the meanings for marketing reasons. In particular <strong>Infrastructure as a service</strong> and <strong>Platform as a service</strong> are marketable at the moment and often used incorrectly. Always look into the details of the services being offered.</p>

<h3 id="ownership">Ownership</h3>

<p>For particularly large projects with very specific requirements you may decide that purchasing hardware and even running a dedicated data centre is suitable. The costs and timescales involved here are very high and this is unlikley to be the best option in most cases.</p>

<h3 id="co-location">Co-location</h3>

<p>Many providers offer co-location services which is where you purchase your own hardware to put into a managed data centre. This provides a great deal of flexibility but can introduce lead times and other physical constrains. It also requires a wide range of technical specialist skills. </p>

<h3 id="shared-or-managed-hosting">Shared or managed hosting</h3>

<p>Lots of service providers have a shared or managed hosting option. This tends to mean renting specific virtual or physical machines for fixed periods of time. Different suppliers other different management services, some just manage the underlying machine while others will support the operating system and even specific applications running on the machines.</p>

<h3 id="infrastructure-as-a-service">Infrastructure as a service</h3>

<p>In the last several years Infrastructure as a service has become a common approach to managing hosting and infrastructure requirements. This tends to involve a capability to rapidly add or remove capacity, often in minutes, and to be billed only for what is used. This provides a great deal of flexibility and the ability to hold costs down but also requires a degree of technical skill to manage well. </p>

<h3 id="platform-as-a-service">Platform as a service</h3>

<p>Similar to Infrastructure as a service above, Platform as a service offerings tend to allow for quickly adding or removing capacity and fine grained pay on demand pricing. The difference is is that you are abstracted away from the underlying infrastructure completely. The unit here is the running application, not a virtual or physical machine. Using a Platform as a service places a number of constrains on the software architecture but can move the support burden for parts of the stack onto the supplier.</p>

<h2 id="make-your-decisions-carefully">Make your decisions carefully</h2>

<p>Making a decision about your hosting supplier involves weighing up a wide range of different components, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>technical requirements of your software applications</li>
  <li>future capacity requirements</li>
  <li>user support</li>
  <li>relisance and redundancy</li>
  <li>mandated government information security requirements</li>
  <li>government network connectivity</li>
  <li>cost of service</li>
  <li>flexibility and on-demand billing</li>
  <li>different operating models, as detailed above</li>
</ul>

<p>This is, unfortunately, a technical field with many options. Seemingly similar services can have wildly different architectures or different cost models can result in large differences in total cost of ownership. It is recommended to involve technical colleagues or trusted third parties in any discussions and descision.</p>
