  <p>Welcome to the Government Service Design Manual. From April this will be the place to find the digital by default service standard, as well as guidance and tools for building world-class digital services.</p>

  <p>This is an experimental beta version of the manual, and it may contain inaccuracies or have gaps.</p>

  <p>We will be working to improve the site before a full release in April. If you have any feedback please email <a href="mailto:dbdss@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">dbdss@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a></p>

      <p>The style guide is set in best practice and relates to how users read. This is an explanation of some of our guidance and the reasons behind the rules.</p>

<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>

<p>Users only really read 20-28% of a web page. With services, where users just want to complete the task as quickly as possible, you have added user impatience so you may find users skim words even more.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/styleguide">The style guide</a> and <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/government-service-design-manual/blob/master/Copy%20and%20content/howtowrite.md">how we write</a> give guidance on how to write. This page details why we do it.</p>

<p>All of this guidance is based on the learning skills of an average person in the UK, who has English as a first language.</p>

<h2 id="reading-age">Reading age</h2>
<p>You don’t read one word at a time. You bounce around. You anticipate words and fill them in.</p>

<p>By the time you are 9 years old, your brain can drop up to 30% of the text and still understand. Your vocabulary will grow but this reading skill stays with you as an adult.</p>

<p>You should also be confident in sounding out words and blending sounds. You may not know the word, but you have the skills to be able to learn it.</p>

<p>We talk about the reading age being around 9 years old - this is why. </p>

<h2 id="lowercase">Lowercase</h2>
<p>When you learn to read, you start with a mix of upper and lower case but you don’t start understanding uppercase until you are around 6 years old. </p>

<p>At first, you may sound out letters, merge sounds, merge letters, learn the word.</p>

<p>Then you stop reading it.</p>

<p>At that point, you recognise the shape of the word. This speeds up comprehension and speed of reading. So we don’t want people to read. We want people to recognise the ‘shape’ of the word and understand. It’s a lot faster. </p>

<p>Caps are reputed to be 13-18% harder for users to read. So we try to avoid them.</p>

<p>Also, in modern usage it sounds like we are shouting. We are government. We should not be shouting.</p>

<h2 id="plain-english">Plain English</h2>
<p>By the time you are 9, you are building up your ‘common words’. Your primary set is around 5,000 words in your vocabulary; your secondary set is around 10,000 words.</p>

<p>These are words you use every day. They are a lot of your ‘plain English’ words. Which is why we should be obsessed with them. These are words so easy to comprehend, you learn to read them quickly and then you stop reading and start recognising. </p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>We explain all unusual terms on GOV.UK. This is because you can understand 6-letter words as easily 2 letter words - if they are in context.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you can read a short word faster than a single letter - if the context is correct.</p>

<p>Not only are we giving users full information - which is obviously what we are meant to be doing - we are speeding up their reading time. By giving full context and using common words, we are allowing them to understand in the fastest possible way. </p>

<p>In tools and transactions you need to give people context. By giving them information they are expecting, you help them get through it faster. </p>

<h2 id="learning-disabilities">Learning disabilities</h2>

<p>This is a huge subject, with many different nuances. But one thing we can do is remember that people with some learning disabilities read letter for letter. They don’t bounce around like other users.</p>

<p>They also can’t retain the comprehension of the sentence as a whole if it is too long.</p>

<p>People with moderate learning disabilities can retain comprehension of 5 to 8 words. Now, we can’t go that far but if we concentrate on common words, we can get to the standard retention figure of around 25 words.</p>

<p>Quite frankly, we all get a bit lost if you have a 72 word sentence. Again, why would we make it hard, when it can be so easy and we don’t lose the usability? </p>

<h2 id="why-we-do-this">Why we do this</h2>

<p>Our audience is potentially anyone living in the UK. We need to be able to communicate in a way that most users understand.</p>

<p>Government can’t afford to be elitist and use language only those with a very good education can understand. We need to open up our information and services to everyone. That means using common words and working with natural reading behaviour.</p>

<h2 id="further-reading">Further reading</h2>
