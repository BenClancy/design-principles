      <p>User stories are an essential part of the agile toolkit, a way of organising work into manageable chunks that each deliver concrete value, which may be then discussed and prioritised independently of each other. User stories only work in the context of an agile team with embedded user representatives.</p>

<h2 id="story-cards">Story cards</h2>

<p class="left"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8372/8358344190_f48b88c254_n.jpg" alt="A user story index card" /></p>

<p>A user story is represented by a story card with a title and a few lines of text.</p>

<p>Story cards can be virtual as well as actual cards. On a large product/service you’re likely to keep your stories in a digital format, and then turn them into physical cards as part of sprint planning.</p>

<p>Story cards follow a standard structure – title, actor, narrative and goal. They do not capture every detail. Rather, they are a promise of further discussion at the appropriate time.</p>

<h2 id="working-outside-in-using-goals">Working outside-in using goals</h2>

<p>Building useful software systems is hard. How can we make sure we’re solving the right problem? Developers love solving problems and playing around with technology, so it can be tempting to dive in to solutions before really understanding the problem. </p>

<p>Agile methodologies emphasise an outside-in approach – what outcome is your service user trying to achieve? If we dive into the solution without a good understanding our users, we risk solving the wrong problem, or coming up with solutions which don’t really work for our users in the real world. That’s why the most important part of a user story is the <strong>GOAL</strong>. </p>

<p>You can also use this goal to help you decide whether the story is “done” or delivered. i.e. Does the work that’s been done meet the goal? </p>

<p>As a service manager writing stories with your development team, always start by thinking about and discussing your users’ goals. Why do they want to use your service? What are they trying to achieve? What need has motivated them to seek out your service? In what context do they use it? At home? At work? On a mobile phone? Whilst caring for a child? How often? <a href="http://www.jconne.com/agile1whatisit/">Suzanne and James Robertson have excellent advice on this</a>. </p>

<p>Being specific about the <strong>ACTOR</strong> can help you to break down interactions into logical chunks. Sometimes the actor will be a user of your service. Sometimes the actor will be an administrator, technician or manager within your organisation. Hopefully you already have a good understanding of your users from preliminary project work or existing research. If not, make sure you take the time to develop that understanding.</p>

<p>Finally the narrative should serve as a reminder of the main flow of interaction which needs to be addressed. However the story card does not need to spell out every detail.</p>

<h2 id="taking-a-rain-check-mdash-the-promise-of-a-conversation">Taking a rain check — the promise of a conversation</h2>

<p><a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">Agile teams prefer face-to-face conversation over detailed documentation</a>. Face-to-face is faster and more accurate than written documentation and allows developers to build up a detailed mental model of the user goals, workflows, constraints and all of the myriad issues which must be taken into account when building a software system. </p>

<p>The story card is just a placeholder, a promise to have a conversation when the time is right. We can use the story card and some brief initial conversations to estimate a story and fit it into an agile backlog. When development work actually starts the users or user proxy can be consulted to fill out the details. The user story is the sum of all of these conversations, sketches and whiteboard diagrams, not just the card. These conversations need never be written down or archived, instead they are translated directly into automated tests and working code.</p>

<p>Using user stories in this way allows us to avoid ‘analysis paralysis’, the painful condition of trying to speculatively detail some far-future goal.</p>

<h2 id="stories-only-work-in-an-agile-team">Stories only work in an agile team</h2>

<p>User stories are dependent on regular face-to-face communication between developers and user representatives. Your service manager and other user representatives need to be available to developers every day, and have sufficient time to think through and answer questions. Don’t underestimate how time-consuming this work can be!</p>

<h2 id="where-stories-come-from">Where stories come from</h2>
<p>Stories can come from many places, but the most common sources include,</p>

<ul>
  <li>story writing workshops - more commonly at the start of a project, the development team and stakeholders will get together to write stories</li>
  <li>user interviews with real users - ideally, you will set up a user panel to which the dev team have ongoing access</li>
  <li>user proxies embedded within your team - this may include the service manager or product owner</li>
  <li>observation - watch real users using your service</li>
</ul>
