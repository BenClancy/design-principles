Jeykll is a simple static site compiler. We're using it here to build a
static site which can make use of basic templates.

When working on the project you can run the following command:

    rake develop

This will start a web server on port 4000, so visit
[localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) and you should see the site. If you change the
templates or code you should see the changes straight away.
