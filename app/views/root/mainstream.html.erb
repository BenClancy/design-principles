          <p>This is a guide to create department and policy content for GOV.UK</p>
        </div>
        <p>‘Department and policy’ content is often more in-depth than ‘services and information’ (mainstream) content, and much of it is aimed at a specialist audience. However, we still need to get to the point in a succinct, concise, usable way.</p>
        
        <p>The main GOV.UK style guide is at: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples">www.gov.uk/designprinciples.</a></p>
        
        <p>GOV.UK is aimed at every citizen in the UK, and those outside of the UK with an interest in the UK government, but particularly those with a professional or personal interest in some aspect of government activity (eg an area of policy) or a part of government (eg an organisation or minister).</p>
        
        <p>We're opening up government information for anyone who's interested enough to look. We need to be clear and informative at all times.</p>
        
        <h2 id="answers">Answers</h2>
        <p>Answers assume prior knowledge and answer a popular and specific need (so you don't need to explain terms or provide context). For example, the answer 'National Minimum Wage rate' should only give the rate, not information about what the National Minimum Wage is, how to pay it, etc (although you should be clearly linking to related content that does).</p>
        <p>Stick exclusively to the answer - don't be tempted to include extra information, however useful this might appear to be.</p>

        <h2 id="answers-summary">Summary</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>one or two sentence(s) summing up the answer for common case (aim for 1)</li>
          <li>get the basic information quickly</li>
          <li>not an introduction</li>
          <li>use summary tags</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="answers-body">Body</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>expand on summary with any necessary detail</li>
          <li>be strict with information you include</li>
          <li>stick to task</li>
          <li>keep it concise; don't overload it with caveats</li>
          <li>no need to repeat info in subhead</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="answers-subheads">Subheads</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>keep as close to search terms as possible</li>
          <li>avoid questions; use statements</li>
          <li>no need for the 'if' (eg 'You're working abroad')</li>
          <li>H2 are primary subs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="answers-formatting">Formatting</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>don't break up text with too many subheads</li>
          <li>use formatting options (eg callouts) but don't overload the page</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="answers-when-an-answer-becomes-a-guide">When an answer becomes a guide</h2>
        <p>When the answer:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>depends on too many things, for example the age of your child and the type of job</li>
          <li>can't be summed up</li>
          <li>is low popularity in search; it can form part of a longer guide so it doesn't clog up the results page</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="benefits-and-schemes">Benefits and schemes</h2>
        <h2 id="benefits-and-schemes-overview-2">Overview</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>give people the main things they want to know without going into detail - eg rate and how long it's paid for</li>
          <li>separate main points (not 1 long paragraph)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="benefits-and-schemes-main-sections">Main sections</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>stick to the title and need</li>
          <li>resist the temptation to provide information around the subject (especially superfluous advice)</li>
          <li>use examples for complex calculations (use example Markdown)</li>
          <li>stick to the common case - any edge cases get put in 'Further information'</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="benefits-and-scheme-further-information">Further information</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>this isn't a dumping ground; content still needs to be useful - if you can't find a place for it, don't use it</li>
          <li>main information for this section: effect on other benefits, appeals and edge cases - also more information on how things are worked out </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="case-studies">Case studies</h2>
        <p>Use for real world examples that helps users understand either:</p>
<ul>
          <li>a process that’s covered on GOV.UK (eg shows someone’s experience of taking part in a particular government programme)</li>
<l>an important aspect of government policy that’s covered on GOV.UK (eg shows someone’s personal experience of a policy problem the government is trying to solve).</l>
</l>

 <h2 id="case-studies-deciding-whether-to-create-a-case-study">Deciding whether to create a case study</h2>
<p>Typically, a user just wants the relevant information in a form that’s as clear and concise as possible. In these circumstances, a case study can be counter-productive: it’s just something else for the user to read, and complicates search results. Usually it’s best to focus on getting the wording of the guidance or policy right instead.</p>

<p>Only create a case study if:</p>
<ul>
          <li>it relates directly to guidance or policy content on GOV.UK - and adds something really important to it</l>
<li>it’s going to be permanently useful (if it’s something that’s more likely to be of temporary interest, consider creating a press release or news story instead)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="case-studies-how-to-avoid-creating-too-many-case-studies">How to avoid creating too many case studies</h2>
<p>Don’t create case studies that are just about promoting your organisation. By definition, a user who’s on GOV.UK is already aware of your orgaisation and what it does: the chances are that they’re looking for concrete information on how to do something. Unnecessary promotional content just creates ‘noise’, making the concrete information harder to find.</p>

<p>Avoid creating 2 case studies illustrating similar points. If you there’s a case study about a policy or process, will a second really add enough to balance the extra ‘noise’ it creates?</p>

  <h2 id="case-studies-what-to-put-on-a-page">What to put on the page</h2>
<p>A case study can be a first person account. Or it can be a third person account including quotes from the subject of the case study.</p> 

<p>Case studies can be in video form.</p>

        <h2 id="case-studies-titles">Titles</h2>
        <p>Summarise the main point of the case study.</p>
<p>Don’t use the words ‘case study’ in the title: they appear on the page automatically.</p>
        <p>Good example:<br />
        UK money helps to build new homes in Darfur</p>
        <p>Bad example:<br />
        After the war</p>

 <h2 id="case-studies-summary">Summary</h2>
 Summarise the main point of the case study in slightly more detail. Write in the third person, even if the case study itself is a first person account.

        <p>Good example:<br />
        'The war in Darfur left many people without homes. We gave the Sudanese government £x money and 500 builders to help build homes for 1,000 families.'</p>

        <h2 id="case-studies-body-copy">Body copy</h2>
        <p>There are no set headings but make sure you include specific facts about:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>how the case study supports a particular policy (include links to the policy/detail pages)</li>
          <li>stats and facts: how many people this is going to help, how much money is going where etc</li>
          <li>the human element: who is benefiting and how</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Context is important, but don’t include too much detail about the past.</p>

<p>Include quotes but don’t overload the page with them unless it is a straight interview. Use 5 or fewer.</p>

        <p>Example:<br />
        The 7-year war in Darfur (2003 to 2010) left x people homeless. Despite the ceasefire in 2010, the region is still unstable and work to rebuild homes is slow.</p>
        <p>We sent [building company, builders etc] to Darfur in June 2011. In 6 months they built 50 homes, which will house 200 people including 130 children.</p>
        <p>George, husband and father of 4 children, said:</p>
        <p>""It has made such a difference to our lives. My wife was ill and our children were getting sick. We were crammed into a tiny house with 5 other families. The living conditions were awful. Now we have a clean house to ourselves. The children share a room but they love the space and get up to mischief."</p>
        <p>Keep to the usual style. Explain any unusual terms and keep a friendly, informative tone. It's not a magazine and we won't be using slang etc but keep the language easy to understand.</p>

       

<h2 id="consultations">Consultations</h2>
<p>Use for consultations, calls for evidence and requests for people’s views on a specific question.

<p>Don’t create separate pages for public feedback and government responses to consultations: just add the documents to the existing page. That way users can always find the latest information about the consultation at the same url.</p>

        <h2 id="consultations-titles">Titles</h2>
        <p>Summarise what the consultation is about. Don’t include the word ‘consultation’ in the title: ‘consultation’ appears on the page automatically.</p>

        <h2 id="consultations-body-text">Body text</h2>
        <p>Give a short, succinct summary of what the consultation is asking people to comment on. Again, keep jargon to an absolute minimum. As government, we have to keep all users in mind. We can't exclude people by using unclear language.</p>
        <p>Keep it to under 100 words.</p>

        <h2 id="consultations-attachments">Attachments</h2>
        <p>When you upload the attachment it will automatically show the front page of the consultation. The type of document, number of pages and file size are captured automatically.</p>
        <p>The title field for this attachment will be displayed as the link text to download or open the file. This should be the full, official title of the publication as written on its front cover.</p>
        <p>When a government response is available, upload those files to the consultation page so that the whole consultation is findable at a single URL.</p>

 <h2 id="corporate-pages-about-us">Corporate pages: about us</h2>
        <p>Tell users what your department actually <strong>does</strong>. Don't give mission statements and visions - tell users what you are actually doing for them and what you are responsible for.</p>

        <h2 id="corporate-pages-what-we-do">What we do</h2>
        <p>Use 'we' throughout - it should be very obvious who the 'we' is on this page more than any other.</p>
        <p>Remember to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>keep it active, personal and relevant</li>
          <li>aim for 30 words</li>
          <li>give an overall view of your department's work - you may want to highlight areas users may not have thought you are responsible for</li>
          <li>make sure you use plain English; this is not the time for optimising jargon words for niche audiences in search - you can do that on specific lower-level pages</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are specific pages for you to give more detail, eg on energy use or governance. Keep this page short and concise.</p>

        <h2 id="corporate-pages-who-we-are">Who we are</h2>
        <p>A few lines about the number of staff you employ and where they are based.</p>

        <h2 id="corporate-pages-responsibilities">Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>Lead with 'We are responsible for:' and bullet a list of your responsibilities. Keep them active, clear and not too detailed - you can do that in your policies.</p>
        <p>Maximum: 7 bullets.</p>

        <h2 id="corporate-pages-priorities">Priorities</h2>
        <p>Lead with: 'In 2013 and 2014, our priorities will be:' [for 2013, obviously; change it according to the time of writing].</p>
        <p>It would be best if you took your main priorities based on your business plan - these are normally specific, clear and succinct.</p>
        <p>Maximum: 7 bullets.</p>

        
        <h2 id="corporate-pages-energy-use">Corporate pages: energy use</h2>
        <p>Tell people which buildings you are monitoring and what you are doing to make sure energy use is efficient.</p>
        <p>Add a link to your energy efficiency certificate as a publication.</p>
        <p>Link to any third-party-hosted real-time energy data tools.</p>

        <h2 id="corporate-pages-personal-information-charter">Corporate pages: personal information charter</h2>
        <p>Lead with: 'Our personal information charter contains the standards you can expect when we ask for, or hold, your personal information. It also covers what we ask of you, to help us keep information up to date.'</p>
        <p>There are no set headings but include why you ask for information, what you do with it and how users can ask to get copies of the information you hold about them. Look at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport/about/personal-information-charter">Department for Transport's personal charter</a> for an example.</p>

        <h2 id="corporate-pages-publication-scheme">Corporate pages: publication scheme</h2>
        <p>Start by telling users what a publication scheme is. The opening paragraph should be:</p>
        <p>''The publication scheme specifies the categories of information that the department and its agencies publish and explains how to get that information.'</p>
        <p>Next, add all your publication links under these headings:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>What we do (H2)</li>
          <li>What we spend and how we spend it (H2)</li>
          <li>How we make decisions (H2)</li>
          <li>What our priorities are and how we are doing (H2)</li>
          <li>Our policies and procedures (H2)</li>
          <li>Lists and registers (H2)</li>
          <li>The services we offer (H2)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you have too many publications, link to a pre-filtered search on the publications page.</p>

        <p>You can then add something like:</p>
        <p>''We generally won't publish information that is:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>protected from disclosure</li>
          <li>in draft form</li>
          <li>no longer readily available</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Archived information previously on our website is available from the National Archives website [then insert a relevant link].</p>
        <p>Then you can go on to say that anything not published under the scheme can be requested under Freedom of Information (FOI) and add your department's FOI contact details.</p>
        <p>End by giving users any additional information you want to include like pricing and contact details. There are no set headings at the moment but we will look at it in the summer of 2013.</p>

        <h2 id="corporate-pages-statistics-at-department">6.5. Corporate pages: statistics at [department]</h2>
        <p>At the moment (April 2013), there's no set style for statistics - we're working on it.</p>
        <p>However, usual usability rules apply: orientate your user in the first paragraph and group your statistics under logical headings so the user can scan easily.</p>
        <p>Have a look at the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-of-energy-climate-change/about/statistics">Department of Energy and Climate Change page</a> as an example.</p>

        <h2 id="corporate-pages-working-with-department">Corporate pages: working with [department]</h2>
        <p>Again, no set headings but include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>what sort of roles you might recruit for</li>
          <li>benefits to working for your department - travel, holiday, pension</li>
          <li>training and development opportunities</li>
          <li>benefits of working for the civil service - sports etc</li>
          <li>a link to <a rel="external" href="http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/recruitment">civil service recruitment</a> or other relevant recruitment websites</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="welsh-language-scheme">Welsh language scheme</h2>
        <p>Use this page to host to organisation’s Welsh language scheme, if it has one.</p>
        
        <h2 id="welsh-language-scheme-summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Use this text:</p>
<p>We treat the English and Welsh languages equally when conducting public business in Wales.</p>
<h2 id="welsh-language-scheme-body-text">Body text</h2>
<p>Adapt this text:</p>
<p><Our Welsh Language Scheme explains what [organisation name] does to make sure the English and Welsh languages are treated equally when we provide public services in Wales./p>

<p>Add the actual scheme as an attachment to  the page (English version then Welsh version).</p>

<p>Don’t include any other information. Refer to [this good example](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions/about/welsh-language-scheme) of how a Welsh language scheme page is set out.</p>




<h1 id="detailed-guides">Detailed guides</h1>
        <p>Detailed guides answer a specific user need for detailed information - usually ending in a user action with government. They are not designed to give general advice, explain government policy or be a dumping ground for information without a home. Use detailed guides for things the user is doing (or needs to).</p>
        
        <h2 id="detailed-guides-title">Title</h2>
        <p>Make titles active where possible - avoid gerunds and participles. For example: 'Submit Statutory Declarations' not 'Using and submitting Statutory Declarations'.</p>
        <p>If you need to use a separator, use a colon. For example: 'Controlled goods: licences, sanctions and embargoes'.</p>
        <p>Maximum title length: 65 characters.</p>
        <p>Only use an acronym in the title if it is a commonly used search term (like SPIRE).</p>
        <p>Where the guide doesn't involve a direct action and is information-led:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>front-load the title with words the user is most likely to have searched for</li>
          <li>make sure the title provides a full context (also helpful for search)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example: 'guidance for potato growers', not 'potatoes'.</p>
        <p>If there are a number of guides with a repeated phrase in the title (eg Manufactured goods: automotive, Manufactured goods: electronic) change the title so that the most important area is front-loaded eg 'Automotive sector: import and export regulations'or 'Chemical sector: import and export regulations'. This is more descriptive and useful for search.</p>

        <h2 id="detailed-guides-summaries">Summaries</h2>
        <p>Use the summary to orientate the user to the page by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>keeping it active</li>
          <li>including a verb</li>
          <li>making it personal</li>
          <li>including primary keywords</li>
          <li>using plain English (no require, obtain etc)</li>
          <li>keeping it succinct</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>summaries take a full stop</li>
          <li>you can use 'An introduction to...' if it's an introduction (ie the guide is short and links to other sources for the main information)</li>
          <li>using 'How to' etc is good</li>
          <li>only use acronyms if they are very common  (eg EU, NATO, etc) or impossible to make a sensible sentence without them</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:<br />
        Title: Organic produce: how to become an importer</p>
        <p>Summary: Find out which organic products can be imported into the UK, how to register as an importer and how to get import authorisation.</p>
        
        <h2 id="detailed-guides-stucture">Structure</h2>
        <p>Make sure your section titles are front-loaded with search terms and make them active. Avoid gerunds (eg 'Apply for a licence' not 'Applying for a licence'). Try not to use questions in section titles.</p>
        <p>Please don't use:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>technical terms in the section title unless unavoidable and then only if they have already been explained</li>
          <li>''introduction' as your first section title - users don't want an intro, just give the most important information</li>
          <li>FAQs - these are normally written because users find content difficult to understand. If you make sure your content is concise and written in plain English, FAQs shouldn't be necessary</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h2 id="detailed-guides-linking">Linking</h2>
        <p>Don't swamp the user with links to other sites or link to the same tool or web page throughout the guide. Only link to other pages on GOV.UK or external sites if this is necessary for the user to complete their journey.</p>
        
        <h2 id="government-responses">Government responses</h2>
<p>Use for government statements in response to coverage in the media, produced by the organisation’s press team: rebuttals, ‘myth busters’ etc.</p>
<p>Don’t use for statements issued to Parliament (use the ‘Statement [to Parliament]’ format for that).
What to put on the page</p>

<h2 id="government-responses-title">Title</h2>
<p>Summarise the government’s position. Avoid starting titles with ‘Statement on ...’ or ‘Government response to ...’: it takes up space without communicating anything useful to the user, and makes it more difficult to tell statements apart.</p>
<p>Don’t put the name of the person making the statement in the title: this information will appear on the page automatically.</p>

<p>A good example:<br />
Syria: international community must act as deaths reach 100,000</p>

<h2 id="government-responses-summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Summarise the main point of the government’s response - expanding on what you’ve said in the title - and indicate what you’re responding to.</p>

<p>The summary also acts and the first sentence of the story, so it should make sense when read continuously with the rest of the page.</p>

<p>A good example:<br />

News reports on the scale of the tragedy show the need for all sides to respect humanitarian efforts and work towards a political solution.</p>

<h2 id="government-responses-body-text">Body text</h2>
<p>Don’t repeat the summary.</p>

<p>Body copy for government responses tends to be shorter than press releases: it’s usually just a quote from the organisation spokesperson. So typically there’s no need for subheadings.</p>



        <h2 id="guides">Guides</h2>

        <h2 id="guides-overview">Overview</h2>
        <p>''Part 1'of the guide should contain the most important information that the majority of users will want to read - you can have an 'overview' but you don't have to.</p>
        <p>Subsequent parts should contain more specific information as well as content for niche audiences.</p>

        <h2 id="guides-parts">Parts</h2>
        <p>You should break content into parts based on user needs as well as the natural structure of the content.</p>
        <p>You don't have to use parts. If you find that you only have 3 or 4 small parts in a guide, consider simply having a page without parts where users can scroll.</p>
        <p>For consistency across the site, these part titles (and where possible, order) should be standard:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Eligibility</li>
          <li>Apply for…</li>
          <li>Appeal against…</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Don't force a linear reading pattern.</p>
        <p>Don't duplicate information but also don't assume people have read all parts of the guide.</p>

            <h2 id="images">Images</h2>
        <p>Use images only when they give useful additional context or information. If it is a picture of a computer keyboard when talking about online services – this is probably not that useful to users. If you use a picture of a new state-of-the-art hospital when it is opened – this probably is useful.</p>
        
        <h2 id="images-how-to-choose-an-image">How to choose an image</h2>
        <p>All images should be 960 pixels wide by 640 pixels wide at 72 DPI. You can resize images using free software like [gimp](http://www.gimp.org) or online photo editors like [pixlr.com](http:/www./pixlr.com).</p>
<p>When choosing an image for a news story or home page feature slot, remember that images directly related to the story are the most effective. For example, the below picture was used to illustrate a story about the appointment of a Chief Social Worker for Children by Education Secretary Michael Gove.</p>
       
      <h2 id="images-image-quality-and-things-to-avoid">Image quality and things to avoid</h2> 
<p>Use good quality imagery. This doesn’t mean images have to be professionally shot: smartphone images are acceptable if the quality is good enough.</p>
<p>If you don’t have access to a photo library, then the Flickr Creative Commons pages are a great place to start looking. (Go to the advanced search section and click ‘Only search within Creative Commons-licensed content.’)</p>
<p>Whatever image you use, it should not be noticeably blurry, grainy, stretched, pixelated or badly lit.</p>


<p>Avoid obvious stock photography like the ones below: they can look cheesy and false. Try not to say too much with the feature images. When in doubt keep the image simple and let the text tell the story.</p>

<p>Also avoid using images of marketing material containing a lot of text. Instead, use the main image from the marketing material and put the relevant text in the story title and description.</p>


<h2 id="images-how-to-format-images">How to format images</h2>
<p>Avoid putting borders around images: the image should go right to the edge of the frame (called ‘full bleed’).</p>

<p>For images with a white background – such as minister portraits – add a light grey overlay to help them stand out from the website background.</p>

<h2 id="images-alt-text">Alt text</h2>
<p>Alt text is used as an alternative to an image for people who use screen readers.</p>

<p>Use alt text where you need to help users understand the visual content. Don’t always make the alt text a literal description of the image: think about what point the image is making. One [excellent piece of advice](http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/11-graphics/8-web-graphics-markup.html#alt-text) is to imagine that you’re reading out the content of the page down a telephone. When you get to the image, what would you say about it to help the listener understand the point the page is making?</p>

<p>If an image is not essential to understanding the content, use empty quote marks: “” as the alt text. For example, don’t tell people there’s a logo on the page. But if there’s a picture of a minister in a tank, put in appropriate alt text describing what’s happening.</p>

<h2 id="images-captions">Captions</h2>
        <p>Use to describe the image, not to summarise the story.</p>

<p>Captions are there to clarify what’s happening in the image, who is pictured etc. They are optional: if you don’t need one, don’t include it.</p>

        <h2 id="images-how-to-attribute-images">How to attribute images</h2>
   <p>Always provide attribution for images (unless it’s an Open Government Licence (OGL) image - in which case there’s no need because it’s already covered by the general statement that GOV.UK content is available under the OGL, unless we say otherwise).</p>  
<p>Attribution should appear at the bottom of the content page that the image is associated with (it isn’t currently possible to put text attribution on organisation homepages).</p> 
 <p>For Creative Commons images, link to the original photo with the person’s name and link to [this licence](http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/) with the words ‘Creative Commons’:</p>

<p>[Photo above by John Smith on Flickr. Used under [Creative Commons.]</p>

<p>If possible, contact the person to check if it’s OK. Think about the context: avoid showing identifiable people in connection with things that may cause offence.</p>


        

        <h2 id="news-stories">News stories</h2>
        <p>News stories are different from press releases:</p>
<ul>
<li>if it’s mostly about putting the organisation’s views on record, it should probably be a press release (or a ‘Government response’)</li>
<li>if it’s mostly about giving users information they can act on, information they need and can’t get from other sources, it should probably be a news story</li>
</ul>

    <h2 id="news-stories-deciding-what-to-publish">Deciding what to publish</h2>
<p>There’s a good chance that most users won’t look at news content.</p>
<p>When we looked at [traffic to government websites](http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/11/07/have-i-got-government-news-for-you/), we found that some were getting as little as 2% of their traffic to news content - and few had much more than a third of users going to the news.</p>

<p>So be selective. When making decisions about what to publish, think about what users need to know rather than what the organisation would like them to see. And bear in mind the need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>avoid duplicating press releases</li>
<li>avoid duplicating other organisations’ news stories</li>
<li>make sure it’s information users can act on (or users need to get information directly from the organisation rather than through the media)</li>
<li>make sure it’s genuine news content</li>
<li>make sure it adds something to existing content</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="news-stories-avoid-duplicating-press-releases">Avoid duplicating press releases</h2>
<p>If you’ve already covered something in a press release, don’t put out a news story with the same information. It’s confusing for users, and means that both pages will perform less well in search.</p>

<h2 id="news-stories-avoid-duplicating-other-organisations'-news-stories">Avoid duplicating other organisations’ news stories</h2>
<p>Any duplication is very obvious on GOV.UK, so stick to your remit and try to anticipate what other organisations will do.</p>
<p>If there’s more than one organisation with an interest in a topical issue, think about producing a joint story - it’s likely to have more impact.</p>
<p>But if two organisations are covering completely different angles and/or addressing differernt audiences, it’s OK to issue separate stories.</p>

<h2 id="news-stories-make-sure-it’s-information-that-users-can-act-on">Make sure it’s information that users can act on (or can’t get from other sources)</h2>
<p>For the most part, government isn’t a provider of news: that’s what media organisations do. We’re a source of news: a maker of announcements.</p> 
<p><So news stories on GOV.UK should provide users with either:/p>
<ul>

<li>information they can act on (eg a government grant scheme opening for applications)</li>
<li>information they would expect to get directly from the organisation rather than through the media (eg information about how changes to public services affect them as public sector employees)</li>
</ul>

<p>Content that’s more about providing comment or explaining the government’s position on a matter of policy is probably more suitable for a press release. Content that’s about explaining the government’s position in response to something in the news is probably better published as a ‘Government response’.</p>

<h2 id="news-stories-make-sure-it’s-genuine-news-content">Make sure it’s genuine news content</h2>
<p>Genuine news content should is self-contained: it should be possible to delete it from the site without affecting anything else. Don’t publish news stories that are actually general purpose content pages.</p>

<p>Also, news stories represent the organisation’s views at a particular moment in time: don’t make changes after they’re published, unless it’s to correct an error.</p>

<h2 id="news-stories-make-sure-it-adds-something-to-existing-content">Make sure it adds something to existing content</h2>
Don’t publish news items just to provide a link through to other GOV.UK content - it confuses user journeys and complicates search results, without adding any benefit for users.

<h2 id="news-stories-article-length">Article length</h2>
        <p>No lower limit, although the value of a story under 150 words should be questioned.</p>
        <p>Upper limit of 750 words - with case-by-case exceptions (eg some Budget pages).</p>

        <h2 id="news-stories-titles">Titles</h2>
        <p>What is the actual story? Tell it in a few words.</p>
        <p>‘Clinical excellence awards’ is not a good title. ‘Clinical excellence awards for healthcare providers: 2013 nominations open’ gives the reader a sense of what’s happening and whether the the story is relevant to them.</p>
        <p>Avoid teasing headlines;, puns or wordplay - these make your story hard for people to find. Use the words most people use for the situation. This helps your search ranking.</p>
        <p>Avoid print conventions 'journalese' eg 'Minister in youth homelessness bid' ('bid' is used in print where headline space is in short supply).</p>
        <p>Good example:<br />
        'Granny in near-death wolf escape'</p>
        <p>Bad example:<br />
        'Girl goes into forest, encounters problems'</p>


        <h2 id="news-stories-summary">Summary</h2>
        <p>Summarise the main point of the story, expanding on what you’ve said in the title.</p>
        <p>The summary also acts and the first sentence of the story, so it should make sense when read continuously with the rest of the page.</p>

        <h2 id="news-stories-body-copy">Body copy</h2>
        <p>Don’t repeat the summary.</p>
        <p>Don’t include more than 2 consecutive sentences of quotes.</p>
        <p>Break up long news stories with subheadings. But remember that subheadings are an addition to the text, not part of it: the text should still make sense with the subheadings removed.</p>
        <p>Here's how to write effective body copy:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>the first paragraph of body copy should lead on from the introduction paragraph - it should not repeat the information</li>
          <li>use the 'inverted pyramid' approach with the most important information at the top tapering down to lesser detail</li>
          <li>paragraphs should have no more than 5 sentences each</li>
          <li>ensure copy includes keywords to boost natural search rankings</li>
          <li>use video and images</li>
        </ul>


        

       
        
          <h2 id="organisation-homepage">Organisation homepage</h2>
 <h2 id="organisation-homepage-top-tasks-links">‘Top tasks’ links</h2>
<p>These are the links at the top right of the home page. They’re intended to help users who have arrived at your home page looking for a service that’s closely associated with your organisation, but is actually covered on the services and information part of GOV.UK.</p>

<p>These links are optional: only keep them if there’s evidence that users are clicking on them. As a guide, each top task link should be followed by no fewer than 2% of total visitors to your homepage (measured in total unique pageviews).</p>

<p>Links should point either to GOV.UK services and information (mainstream) content, or information or tools on domains outside GOV.UK. The text of the link must be as specific and active as possible, and not overlap with titles used for ‘corporate’ content types.</p>

<p>Don’t include anything that’s already covered by a link on the organisation home page (eg contact details, lists of announcements or publications, blogs or social media channels).</p>

<p>Don’t include microsites or campaign sites unless there’s evidence of significant user demand.</p>

<h2 id="organisation-homepage-feature-slots">Feature slots</h2>

<p>Don’t feel that you have to use all the feature slots: the fewer content items you feature, the more they stand out. Remember that anything you feature needs to have an image.</p>

<h2 id="organisation-homepage-contact details">Contact details</h2>
Include a point of contact for general enquiries and a point of contact for freedom of information (FOI) requests. Additional contact details are optional.

        
                <h2 id="people and roles">People and roles</h2>
        <p>Use these pages to let people know who is responsible for running the organisation at the highest level.</p>
        
        <p>Create GOV.UK profiles for:</p>
        <ul><

<li>ministers</li>
<li>the organisation’s most senior official (ie the permanent secretary or chief executive)</li>
<li>the organisation’s top tier of management (usually directors general)
</li><li>senior officials with a public leadership role (eg Chief Scientist, Chief Medical Officer, military chiefs, ambassadors, high commissioners)</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t create ‘People’ pages for anyone else.</p>

<h2 id="people-and-roles-biography">Biography</h2>
<p>Keep it short. One or two short paragraphs (one or two sentences each) or a single lead sentence with 5 bullets or fewer will do. If it’s a long career, just provide the highlights.</p>

<p>The first paragraph should cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>the person’s full name (without title and letters, as it will appear directly above the text)</li>
<li>their current job title, and when they were appointed</li>
</ul>

<p>In the second paragraph, provide a little information about the person’s background. You can either:</p>
<ul>

<li>list up to 5 previous roles as bullet points, with the most recent at the top (if it’s long career, just provide the highlights)</li>
<li>say something more general about the types of role they’ve had in the past</li>
</ul>

<p>At first mention use the full name. After that, use the first name. So ‘Philip Rutnam’ at first mention, then ‘Philip’ after that.</p>

<p>Don’t include information about their personal life, eg marital status, children, hobbies etc.</p>

<p>Don’t use headings or subheadings.</p>

<p>All ‘people’ pages should include a headshot of the person concerned. Images should be 960 pixels wide by 640 pixels wide and 72 DPI (like all images on GOV.UK).</p>

<p>Avoid putting borders around images – the image should go right to the edge of the frame (called ‘full bleed’). If the image has a white background, add a light grey overlay to make it stand out from the website background:</p>

<h2 id="people-and-roles-choosing-a-role">Choosing a role</h2>
<p></p>
Currently we can give people these roles:
<ul>
<li>permanent secretary</li> 
<li>board member</li>
<li>Chief of the Defence Staff or Chief of Staff (for members of the armed forces)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you think GOV.UK needs a new role type, [let us know](https://support.production.alphagov.co.uk/).</p>

<h2 id="people-and-roles-ministerial-biographies">Ministerial biographies</h2>
        <p>Remember to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>keep it short; half a page is plenty for a bio</li>
          <li>lead with: '[name] was appointed [title] in [date]. [He/she] is the [party] MP for [constituency]'</li>
          <li>first name terms: The Rt Hon Nick Clegg MP at the top of the page, then use Nick Clegg at first mention, then Nick</li>
          <li>a Lord or Baroness will always use their title and surname eg Baroness Warsi</li>
          <li>education: avoid 'read'; use 'studied'</li>
          <li>political career: a few sentences of career highlights in chronological order; if this is long, use bullet points, with an introductory sentence</li>
          <li>career outside politics: if none, use 'Political career'</li>
          <li>personal life: don't include children's names and/or delete this section if you don't need it</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: when talking about ministers who have previously held a role, use their first name and surname.</p>

<h2 id="people-and-roles-writing-copy-to-describe-a-role">Writing copy to describe a role/h2>
<p>Give a brief description of the role: no more than 5 bullet points.</p>

<p>Don’t use headings or subheadings.</p>

<p>Be specific when listing responsibilities. For example, don’t use:</p>

<p>The minister is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>drugs</li>
<li>alcohol</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead, use:</p>
<pi>The minister is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>reducing drug misuse</li>
<li>reducing harmful drinking</li>
</ul>
A good example:



        <h2 id="people-and-roles-management-biographies">Management biographies</h2>
        <p>Use a maximum of 3 sentences to explain what the manager is doing and 5 bullets on career highlights.</p>


        <h2 id="policy-pages">9. Policy pages</h2>
        <p>A policy is how the government plans to achieve a specific outcome.</p>
        <p>Policies on GOV.UK have 4 parts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a title</li>
          <li>a cover sheet</li>
          <li>latest tab (this is generated automatically)</li>
          <li>supporting detail pages</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="policy-pages-titles">Titles</h2>
        <p>Policy titles should express the specific outcome the government is seeking to achieve. They should be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>clear</li>
          <li>succinct</li>
          <li>specific enough to allow someone to measure progress and achievement</li>
          <li>jargon-free</li>
          <li>active: eg 'increasing x', 'reducing y', 'preventing z', 'protecting x from y'</li>
          <li>related to an outcome</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Use words the wider audience would use. Don't use 'The x report' unless that search term is higher than the explanation of what 'The x report' says.</p>
        <p>Good examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Expanding and improving the rail network</li>
          <li>Making roads safer</li>
          <li>Increasing the number of successful small businesses</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Bad examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Charter for business</li>
          <li>Tackling climate change</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="policy-pages-issue-mandatory">Issue (mandatory)</h2>
        <p>This should answer the question 'why does the government have this policy?'</p>
        <p>Give a short, clear and specific description of the problem or opportunity and a brief explanation of what the government is going to do or is doing about it.</p>
        <p>This section isn't:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>about the history</li>
          <li>what led to the policy being implemented</li>
          <li>the government's actions or intended actions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:<br />
        The public sector - including central government, local councils and devolved administrations - accounts for around 3% of the UK's carbon emissions. In England alone, the government spends £2.5 billion on energy for buildings and £1.2 billion on owned-vehicle fuel.</p>
        <p>Improving energy efficiency in the public sector will result in a better use of taxpayers' money and help the UK meet existing climate change agreements.</p>

        <h2 id="policy-pages-actions-mandatory">Actions (mandatory)</h2>
        <p>This section details what the government is doing about the issue or to achieve the outcome in the policy title.</p>
        <p>Actions should be specific, measurable and time-bound.</p>
        <p>Summarise briefly what government is doing now and what it will do next - 1 short paragraph or bullet point for each action with links to supporting detail pages where relevant.</p>
        <p>Past actions go into the background section. If an action was taken in the past but the effects are still being felt (eg the benefits of successfully lobbying the EU), then it is still current. If an action was taken, and then replaced by related and further action, policy, etc, then it's background.</p>
        <p>Example:<br />
        To increase our energy efficiency, by 2015 the government will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% from the whole estate and business-related transport, by introducing x scheme</li>
          <li>make sure the goods, services and suppliers it chooses are energy efficient</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="policy-pages-background-mandatory">Background (mandatory)</h2>
        <p>This section should explain how this policy and set of actions came about. Provide essential information for understanding the context of the policy, issue and actions.</p>
        <p>This isn't a dumping ground for information that doesn't fit the other headings, nor a history of everything, but a clear indication of how the policy got to where it is.</p>
        <p>Example:<br />
        We announced our intention to do x as part of the coalition agreement.</p>
        <p>We commissioned research into y in 2010. This showed that that the most cost-effective and useful action we could take would be to do z.</p>
        <p>We consulted experts at an event in 2011 and worked with aaa and bbb to develop our action plan.</p>

        <h2 id="policy-pages-who-were-consulting-or-who-weve-consulted-optional-and-depending-on-time">Who we're consulting or who we've consulted (optional and depending on time)</h2>
        <p>Explain who has been or will be consulted or involved in the policy, and in what way.</p>
        <p>List any consultations - formal or informal. Give some detail about what is being done and by whom. Don't just add a list of links.</p>
        <p>Example:<br />
        The government ran a consultation on 'Breaking the cycle: effective punishment, rehabilitation and sentencing of offenders'. This set out our proposals for effectively punishing and rehabilitating offenders and reforming sentencing. Following that consultation, we revised our plans to xxx and yyy.</p>

        <h2 id="policy-pages-impact-optional">Impact (optional)</h2>
        <p>List (and link inline to) any impact assessment publications.</p>
        <p>Briefly summarise the main points arising from the impact assessments.</p>

        <h2 id="policy-pages-bills-and-legislation-optional">Bills and legislation (optional)</h2>
        <p>Give summary details of relevant legislation to explain the legal context for the policy and if the policy will mean changes to the law.</p>
        <p>Write full sentences, not just a list of related laws, and add links where relevant.</p>

        <h2 id="policy-pages-who-we-are-working-with-optional">Who we are working with (optional)</h2>
        <p>List the organisations that have a major involvement, and what work is being done by them or with them.</p>
        <p>Write full sentences, don't just list the organisations.</p>

        <h2 id="policy-pages-detail-pages-optional">Detail pages (optional)</h2>
        <p>These pages are for users who want to know more about the actions listed on the cover sheet. So have 1 detail page for each action.</p>
        <p>They should provide supporting detail about the issue and actions.</p>
        <p>For example, if the actions include a programme costing £x and running for 6 months, the detail page should provide further information about who is involved, what they are spending the money on and how.</p>
        <p>These pages must not be used as a dumping ground for material that doesn't fit under other headings.</p>
        <p>If appropriate, include a supplementary detail page called 'evidence' or 'research'. This can be used to present the most important research and statistics relating to the policy.</p>
     
     <h2 id="press-releases">Press releases</h2>   
        
<p>Use to provide a record of press releases in unedited form (ie as produced by the organisation’s press team and sent to the media).</p>

<p>Also use for official statements by an organisation spokesperson or minister (unless it’s a Parliamentary statement - in which case use the ‘Statement [to Parliament]’ format).</p>

<h2 id="press-releases-title">Title</h2>  
<p>Summarise the main point of the story.</p>
<p>Avoid starting titles with ‘Statement on ...’ or something similar: it just takes up space without communicating anything useful to the user, and makes it more difficult to tell one press release from another.</p>
<p>Don’t put ‘press release’’ or the name of the person making the statement in the title: this information will appear on the page automatically.</p>

<p>A good example:<br />
Mums and dads to share parental leave</p>

<h2 id="press-releases-summary">Summary</h2> 
<p>Summarise the main point of the story (in slightly longer form than in the title).</p>
<p>The summary also acts as the first sentence of the story, so it should make sense when read continuously with the rest of the page.</p>
<p>Maximum of 140 characters. End with a full stop.</p>

<p>A good example:<br />
New arrangements for maternity leave and paternity leave mean that parents will be able to choose how they share care responsibilities.</p>

<h2 id="press-releases-body text">Body text</h2> 
<p>Don’t repeat the summary.</p>Body text
<p>Break up long press releases with subheadings. But remember that subheadings are an addition to the text, not part of it: the text should still make sense with the subheadings removed.</p>
<p>If you need to add notes at the end, a subheading like ‘Background’ is better than ‘Notes to editors’ or similar.</p>



        <h2 id="publications">Publications</h2>
        <p>Publications are standalone documents. They are date-stamped and usually not updated once published. Don't use publications when you should be adding an attachment to another Inside Government format, for example: meeting minutes and agendas should be attachments.</p>

        <h2 id="publications-titles">Titles</h2>
        <p>Titles don't have to reflect the official publication title. Keep them short and search- and user-friendly.</p>
        <p>Front-load all titles - get all the most important words at the front of the sentence.</p>
        <p>Good example:<br />
        'Income Tax reform: impact assessment'</p>
        <p>Bad example:<br />
        'An assessment of the impact of proposed reforms to Income Tax'</p>
        <p>You can mention the report title etc in the summary or page copy if you think users will search for that term.</p>
        <p>Good example:<br />
        'Improving government online services'</p>
        <p>Bad example:<br />
        'The Varney report'</p>
        <p>For transparency titles:<br />
        'DfT special advisers: gifts and hospitality received, 13 May to 31 July 2010'</p>
        <p>Note: use acronyms, colons and truncated dates.</p>


        <h2 id="publications-summary">Summary</h2>
        <p>Give a short, 140 character summary and end with a full stop.</p>

        <h2 id="publications-body-text">Body text</h2>
        <p>The body of a publication page is used to provide a summary of the publication in plain, neutral language - to reassure the user that it is (or isn't) what they're looking for. Include what the publication is about and its purpose. Publications often outlive governments so keep the language politically neutral.</p>
        <p>Include links to related publications but use series to group them if more than a few.</p>
        <p>Good example:<br />
        'These reports describe the effect of government proposals to reduce the amount of money spent on legal aid. The aim of the reforms is to make sure legal aid is still available for support and representation in cases where it is justified.'</p>

        <h2 id="publications-attachments-title-field">Attachments</h2>
        <p>Use the official title of the document.</p>

        <h2 id="publications-document-series">Document series</h2>
        <p>The name of each document series should be concise, in plain English and have front-loaded keywords etc. Usual usability rules apply.</p>
        <p>It should not include the department name or acronym - transparency series are the only exception to this.</p>
        <p>Use the description field to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>say what the series covers</li>
          <li>give context</li>
          <li>outline which audience the information is for</li>
          <li>include keywords</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember the description is given the header 'In this series' on the site, so don't begin your description with, 'In this series…'.</p>
        <h2 id="publications-transparency-series">Transparency series</h2>
        <p>Unlike other series, series of transparency documents can and should include the acronym for the department - or the full name, where it is short (Home Office, for example).</p>
        <p>The series titles should follow this pattern: 'Dept name/acronym: type of spending/information covered'</p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>DfT: spend for transactions over £25,000</li>
          <li>BIS: contracts and tenders worth over £10,000</li>
          <li>DfE: special advisers' meetings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The year/months covered can be included at the end of the series name, if necessary - although usually these series are broad, with the titles of the publications within them containing the more specific date information.</p>
       
        <h2 id="publications-speeches">Speeches</h2>
        <p>Use this content type to provide a direct record of what someone said.</p>
        <p>GOV.UK supports 3 types of speech:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>transcript (for verbatim reports of exactly what the speaker said - also known as 'checked against delivery')/li>
          <li>draft (for reports of what the speaker was supposed to say - also known as 'check against delivery')</li>
          <li>speaking notes (if it’s not a complete speech - eg it’s a summary of topics covered)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Only publish speeches on GOV.UK you expect a high level of public interest in everything that what was said - not just the main messages. Otherwise it’s better to publish a ‘Press release’ or ‘Government response’ quoting selected highlights, along with some commentary and analysis.
</p>

<h2 id="publications-speeches-title">Title/h2>

<p>Summarise the main point of the speech in the title. Go for something like the titles used for newspaper comment pieces.</p>

<p>Don’t include the word ‘speech’ in the title (it’s added to the page automatically).</p>

<p>Don’t include anything about the speaker, date, venue or audience in the title (the date and speaker appear on the page automatically: if it’s needed, put information about the venue or audience the summary).</p>
 
<p>A good example:<br />

<National security and civil liberties: getting the balance right/p>

<h2 id="publications-speeches-summary">Summary/h2>
<p>Give details of the occasion for the speech (including any terms that people are likely to be searching for).</p>

<p>A good example:<br />
Speech given at the Living Streets supporters conference 2013. Originally given in London. This is a transcript of the speech, exactly as it was delivered.</p>

<p>The second and third sentences are inserted into the summary automatically, based on what’s entered into the relevant fields in Publisher.</p>

<h2 id="publications-statements-to-parliament">Statements [to Parliament]/h2>

<p>Use this content type for very significant statements given to Parliament by a minister (written or oral).</p>

<p>Don’t use it for statements made to the media (use the ‘Press release’ or ‘Government response’ content types for that sort of thing).</p>

<p>There’s no need to publish statements to Parliament on GOV.UK as a matter of record (that’s what Hansard is for).</p>

<p>Only publish them on GOV.UK as well if:
<ul>
<li>you expect a high level of public interest in everything that what was said - not just the main messages<</li>
<li>they are necessary context for understanding how a policy is progressing</li> 

<p>Otherwise it’s better to publish a ‘Press release’ or ‘Government response’ quoting selected highlights, along with some commentary and analysis).</p>

<h2 id="publications-statements-to-parliament-title">Title/h2>
<p>Don’t use the words ‘statement’ or Parliament’ in the title (the words ‘Oral statement to Parliament’ or ‘Written statement to Parliament’ will appear on the page automatically).</p>

<p>A good example:<br />

Problems with Action Fraud IT system</p>

<h2 id="publications-statements-to-parliament-summary">Summary/h2>
<p>Again - there’s no need to specify whether it’s a written or oral statement in the summary (this information appears on the page anyway), and no need to say that the statement was given to Parliament (that’s self-evident).</p>

<p>A good example:<br />

Statement on Action Fraud reports not processed correctly due to a fault in the IT system.</p>
