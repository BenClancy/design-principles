        <h1 id="ig">4. Style differences:<br />Inside Government formats</h1>
        <h2>About this document</h2>
        <p>This guidance is for the formats on Inside Government (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government">www.gov.uk/government</a>). The main GOV.UK style guide is at: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples">www.gov.uk/designprinciples.</a></p>
        
         <p>The site is aimed at every citizen in the UK, and those outside of the UK with an interest in the UK government, but particularly those with a professional or personal interest in some aspect of government activity (eg an area of policy) or a part of government (eg an organisation or minister).</p>
         
    

        <h2 id="ig-users">4.1 Inside Government users</h2>
            <p>Inside Government users usually prefer more in-depth information and some of the content has a specialist audience. However, the premise is still to get to the point of the information in a succinct, concise, usable way. </p>
            
            <p>There is no space for waffle anywhere on GOV.UK. </p>
            
           <p> We are opening up government information for anyone who is interested enought to look. We need to be clear and informative at all times.</p>
            
        <p>If you are giving your users more detail, you&rsquo;ll need to consider internal links to supporting pages etc more closely. The user journey and architecture within a topic or audience pages can become so swamped with detail, it becomes unusable. So there&rsquo;s your challenge.</p>
       

        <h2 id="Addressing-the-user">4.1.1 Addressing the user</h2>
        <p>Style differences</p>

        <p>Mainstream: Don&rsquo;t use &lsquo;we&rsquo;, &lsquo;I&rsquo;, &lsquo;our&rsquo;, &lsquo;us&rsquo;.<br />
          Inside Government: Use &lsquo;we&rsquo; if the &lsquo;we&rsquo; is obvious from the context, eg it&rsquo;s clearly a department or the government.</p>

        <h2 id="Jargon">4.1.2 Jargon</h2>
        <p>On <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government">www.gov.uk/government</a>, sometimes it will be impossible to avoid unusual words or phrases &ndash; but these must be explained where possible. There is no need to explain common terms of reference, eg climate change, but something like The Green Deal does need explaining, or linking to a definition. You can use supporting detail pages to explain complicated background if needed. It&rsquo;s our job to make government understandable to anyone. This includes people with poor literacy skills.</p>

        <p>have a look at the <a href="id="words-to-avoid>words to avoid list</a>for some of the jargon we shouldn&rsquo;t be using.</a> </p>
       
        
        <h2 id="active-voice">4.1.3 Active voice</h2>
        <p>Use the active rather than the passive voice, eg &lsquo;we are doing this&rsquo;, rather than &lsquo;this is being done&rsquo;.</p>

        <h2 id="capitalisation">4.1.4 Capitalisation</h2>
        <p>Don&rsquo;t capitalise words just because you think they are important. It&rsquo;s hard on the eye and can seem pompous. So don&rsquo;t write, &lsquo;BIS is committed to increasing the number of Apprenticeships.&rsquo;</p>

        <p>Capitalise:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>job titles, ministers&rsquo; role titles eg Minister for Housing, Home Secretary</li>
          <li>names of groups and directorates eg Knowledge and Innovation Group</li>
          <li>Parliament, the House</li>
          <li>an Act or a Bill</li>
          <li>titles of specific Acts or Bills eg Housing Reform Bill</li>
          <li>names of specific, named government schemes known to people outside government eg Right to Buy, Queen&rsquo;s Awards for Enterprise</li>
          <li>specific select committees (eg Public Administration Select Committee)</li>
          <li>header cells in tables</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Don&rsquo;t capitalise:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>government &ndash; never Government, even when referring to the elected administration, unless part of a specific name, eg Local Government Association, or Inside Government</li>
          <li>minister, never Minister, unless part of a specific job title, eg Minister for the Cabinet Office</li>
          <li>department or ministry &ndash; never Department or Ministry, unless referring to a specific one, eg Ministry of Justice</li>
          <li>the titles of publications &ndash; only initial cap on first word and the entire title in single quote marks eg &lsquo;Implementing self-financing for council housing&rsquo; (unless it includes a phrase which should be capitalised for other reasons eg &lsquo;Review of the Right to Buy scheme&rsquo;)</li>
          <li>white paper, green paper, command paper, House of Commons paper</li>
          <li>director general (note no hyphen), deputy director, director unless in a specific job title</li>
          <li>group and directorate, unless referring to a specific group or directorate, eg Commercial Directorate</li>
          <li>departmental board, executive board, the board</li>
          <li>policy themes eg sustainable communities, promoting economic growth, local enterprise zones</li>
          <li>general mention of select committees (but DO cap specific ones &ndash; see above)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>DON&rsquo;T USE BLOCK CAPITALS FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF TEXT AS IT&rsquo;S QUITE HARD TO READ.</p>

        <h2 id="images">4.2 Images</h2>
        <p>What&rsquo;s the actual purpose of the image? If it is a picture of a computer keyboard when talking about online services &ndash; this is probably not that useful. If you use a picture of a new state-of-the-art hospital when it is opened &ndash; this probably is useful.</p>
        <p>Image size for featuring: 960x640 pixels, 72 dpi, landscape</p>

        <h2 id="attribution">4.2.1 Attribution</h2>
        <p>When attributing images, use this format:<br />
          Francis Maude shakes hands with Mark Serwotka. Picture: George Roberts / Crown copyright.</p>

        <h2 id="alt-text">4.2.2 Alt text</h2>
        <p>Alt text is used as an alternative to an image for people who use screen readers.</p>
        <p>Use alt text where you need to help users understand the visual content. If an image is not essential to understanding the content, use &ldquo;&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>For example, don&rsquo;t tell people there is a logo on the page. However, if there is a picture of a minister in a tank, put an appropriate description.</p>

        <h2 id="captions">4.2.3 Captions</h2>
        <p>Keep captions under 140 characters including attribution if possible. Exceptions can be made if necessary.</p>

        <h2 id="job-titles">4.2.4 Job titles</h2>
        <p>In the first instance, refer to a minister by their commonly known title, eg Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke. After that, refer to them by name only, eg Kenneth Clarke.</p>
        <p>In some instances, like appointments or official communications, you may have to refer to someone by their full title, eg The Right Honourable Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice Kenneth Clarke.</p>
        <p>Ministers and MPs are given their full titles without the Mr or Mrs &ndash; for example, Prime Minister David Cameron. Use the commonly understood acronym MPs where possible, not Members of Parliament.</p>

        <h2>Formats </h2>
        
        <h2 id="case-studies">5. Case studies</h2>

      <h3>Titles</h3>
      <p>These can be more &lsquo;newsy&rsquo; than policy titles but give the reader a clear idea of what they are going to get.</p>
      <p>Remember how the title will look in search on GOV.UK and on search engines: you are now on a site with (potentially) similar titles for policies and news articles. Make sure you are making your titles clear for the format you are using.</p>
      <p>Good example: UK money helps to build new homes in Darfur</p>

      <p>Bad example: After the war</p>

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>140 character limit. Remember this is for search so make sure you have enough specific facts to inform the user. </p>

      <h3>Opening paragraph</h3>
      <p>One paragraph, 3 sentences or fewer. You want a short, sharp introduction that gives facts: what happened, why and what was the result.</p>


      <p>Good example:</p>
      <p>The war in Darfur left many people without homes. We gave the Sudanese government &pound;x money and 500 builders to help build homes for 1,000 families.</p>


      <h3>Body copy</h3>
      <p>There are no set headings but make sure you include specific facts about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>how the case study supports the policy (include links to the policy/detail pages)</li>
        <li>stats and facts: how many people this is going to help, how much money is going where etc</li>
        <li>the human element: who is benefiting and how</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Example:</p>

      <p>The seven-year war in Darfur (2003 to 2010) left x people homeless. Despite the ceasefire in 2010, the region is still unstable and work to rebuild homes is slow.</p>

      <p>We sent [building company, builders etc] to Darfur in June 2011. In 6 months they built 50 homes, which will house 200 people including 130 children.</p>

      <p>George, husband and father of 4 children said:</p>
      <p>&ldquo;It has made such a difference to our lives. My wife was ill and our children were getting sick. We were crammed into a tiny house with 5 other families. The living conditions were awful. Now we have a clean house to ourselves. The children share a room but they love the space and get up to mischief.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Keep to the usual style. Explain any unusual terms and keep a friendly, informative style. It is not a magazine and we won&rsquo;t be using slang etc but keep the language easy to understand.</p>

        
      <h3>Video</h3>
      <p>You can use them. The format has to be: http://www.youtube/[filename] (Later there will be functionality inside the publisher to add a transcript.)</p>


      <h3>Images</h3>
      <p>What&rsquo;s the actual purpose of the image? If it is a picture of a keyboard when talking about online services &ndash; this is probably not that useful. If you use a picture of a new state-of-the-art hospital when it is opened &ndash; this probably is useful.
      <p>Image size: 960x640 pixels, 72 dpi</p>

      <p>The first image on the page will be placed automatically, top left.  Subsequent images, and all videos, can be placed in the relevant part of the text using markdown.</p>

      <h3>Attribution</h3>
      <p>When attributing images, use this format:</p>
      <p>Francis Maude shakes hands with Mark Serwotka. Picture: George Roberts / Crown copyright.</p>

      <h3>Alt text</h3>
      <p>Alt text is used as an alternative to an image for people who use screen readers.</p>
      <p>Use alt text where you need to help users understand the visual content. If an image is not essential to understanding the content, use &ldquo;&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>For example: don&rsquo;t tell people there is a logo on the page. However, if there is a picture of a minister in a tank, put an appropriate description.</p>

      <h3>Quotes</h3>
      <p>Include quotes but don&rsquo;t overload the page with them unless it is a straight interview. Use 5 or fewer. You are telling a story. Use the quotation markdown for each paragraph.</p>

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>Giving context is important but don&rsquo;t overload the page with the past.</p>
        
        <h2 id="about-us">6. Corporate pages: about us</h2>
        <p>Whilst most of the &lsquo;about us&lsquo; pages are mandated by some part of government, the only page we mandate is &lsquo;what we do&rsquo;.</p>

        <h3>What we do</h3>
        <p>Use &lsquo;we&rsquo; throughout &ndash; is should be very obvious who the &lsquo;we&rsquo; is on this page more than any other.</p> 
        <p>Remember to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>keep it active, personal and relevant</li>
          <li>aim for 30 words</li> 
          <li>give an overall view of your department&rsquo;s work &ndash; you may want to highlight areas users may not have thought you do</li> 
          <li>make sure you use plain English &ndash; this is not the time for SEO-ing jargon words for niche audiences. You can do that on specific lower-level pages</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>Lead with &lsquo;We are responsible for:&rsquo; and bullet a list of your responsibilities. Keep them active, clear and not too detailed &ndash; you can do that in your policies.</p>
        <p>Max of 7 bullets.</p>

       <h3>Priorities</h3>
        <p>Lead with: &lsquo;In 2012 to 2013, our priorities will be:&rsquo; (for this year, obviously. Change it next year.)</p>
        <p>It would be best if you took your main priorities based in your business plan &ndash; these are normally specific, clear and succinct.</p> 
        <p>Max of 7 bullets.</p>
        
        <h2 id="biographies">6.1. Corporate pages: biographies</h2>
        <h3>Ministerial biographies</h3>
        <p>Remember to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>keep it short; half a page is plenty for a bio</li>
          <li>biography: begin with the appointment, full title and constituency</li>
          <li>first name terms:  The Rt Hon Nick Clegg MP at the top of the page, then use Nick Clegg at first mention,   then Nick. </li>
          <li>a Lord or Baroness will always use their title and surname eg Baroness Warsi</li>
          <li>education: avoid &lsquo;read&rsquo; &ndash; use &lsquo;studied&rsquo;</li>
          <li>political career: a few sentences of career highlights in chronological order. If this is long, use bullet points, with an introductory sentence</li>
          <li>career outside politics: If none, use &lsquo;Political career&rsquo; </li>
          <li>personal life: delete this section if you don't need it and don't include children&rsquo;s names</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Management biographies</h3>
        <p>Use a maxumum of 3 sentences to explain what the manager is doing and 5 bullets on career highlights.</p>
        
      <h2 id="energy-use">6.2. Corporate pages: Energy use</h2>
      <p>Include what you are doing and don&rsquo;t try to blind people with science and unnecessary stats but make sure it is relevant. Tell people which buildings etc you are monitoring and what you are doing to make sure use is efficient.</p>

      <p>Include a copy of your energy efficiency certificate as a publication.</p>

      <p>Link to any 3rd party hosted real time energy data tools.  (We will look to support embedding of these tools in the longer term.)</p>

      <h2 id="personal-information-charter">6.3. Corporate pages: personal information charter</h2>
      <p>Lead with: &lsquo; Our personal information charter contains the standards you can expect when we ask for, or hold, your personal information. It also covers what we ask of you, to help us keep information up to date.&rsquo; </p>

      <p>There are no set headings but include why you ask for information, what you do with it and how users can ask to get copies of the information you hold. Look at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport/about/personal-information-charter">DfT's personal charter</a> for an example. </p>


      <h2 id="working-with">6.4. Corporate pages: working with [dept]</h2>
      <p>Again, no set headings but include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>what sort of roles you might recruit for</li>
        <li>benefits to working for your departments &ndash; travel, holiday, pension</li>
        <li>training and development opportunities</li>
        <li>benefits of working for the civil service &ndash; sports etc</li>
        <li>a link to Civil Service or other relevant recruitment websites</li>
      </ul>
      
       <h2 id="consultations">6.5 Consultations</h2>
        <p> The style is the same as publications but this is your chance to really get users engage with government &ndash; use it. Be specific, clear, open and findable.</p>
     

        <h2>Body text &ndash; what it&rsquo;s for</h2>
        <p>Give a short, succinct summary of what the consultation is asking people to comment on.</p>

        <h2>How to respond</h2>
        <p>On all open consultations, add information in the body copy on how to respond in the following format:</p>
        <p>##How to respond</p>
        <p>###Respond online<br />
          Add a url if there is one</p>
        <p>###Email us<br />
          email@email.com</p>
        <p>###Write to us<br />
          Address</p>

        <h2>Attachments</h2>
        <p>When you upload the attachment it will automatically show the front page of the consultation. The type of document, number of pages and file size are captured automatically.</p>
        <p>The title field for this attachment will be displayed as the link text to download or open the file. This should be the full, official title of the publication as written on its front cover.</p>


        <h2 id="welsh-language-scheme">6.6. Welsh language scheme
        <p>Whilst this is a legal scheme there is no need to lose users with garbled, legal language. Make it easy for users to understand what the scheme means for them.</p>

      <br>
      <p>We are still looking at the publication charter and statistics styles.</p>


      <h2 id="reminders-for-all-pages">Corporate pages: reminders for all pages</h2> 
      <p>Rememeber that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>summaries take a full stop</li>
        <li>think about how the information looks on the page &ndash; remember subheads and bullets</li>
        <li>keep it plain English but use and explain jargon if your users will be looking for specific terms</li>
        <li>no &lsquo;legalese&rsquo;:we are trying to open up all government information &ndash; even the legal stuff</li>
      </ul>
      
       <h2 id="detailed guidance">7. Detailed guidance</h2>
      <p>Detailed guides answer a specific user need for detailed information &ndash; usually ending in a user action with government. It&rsquo;s not to give general advice, explain government policy or a dumping ground for information without a home.  </p>
      
      <h3>Title</h3>
      <p>Make all titles active where possible &ndash; avoid gerunds and participles. For example: &lsquo;Submit Statutory Declarations&rsquo; not &lsquo;Using and submitting Statutory Declarations&rsquo;</p>
      <p>If you need to use a separator, use a colon. For example: &lsquo;Controlled goods: licences, sanctions and embargoes&rsquo; </p>
      <p>Maximum title length: 65 characters ideally (unless highly technical phrases are essential).</p>
      <p>Only use acronyms in the titles if they are search terms.</p>

<p>Where the guide doesn&rsquo;t involve a direct action and is information-led:</p>
<ul>
<li>frontload the title with words the user is most likely to have searched for</li>
<li>make sure the title provides a full context (also helpful for search)</li>
</ul>

<p>For example: &rsquo;guidance for potato growers&rsquo;, not &lsquo;potatoes&rsquo;</p></p>


<p>If there are a number of guides with a repeated phrase in the title (eg Manufactured goods: automotive, Manufactured goods: electronic) change the title so that the specific area (which is the most important) covered is front-loaded eg &lsquo;Automotive sector: import and export regulations&rsquo; or &lsquo;Chemical sector: import and export regulations&rsquo;. This is more descriptive and useful for SEO.</p>

<h3>Summaries</h3>

<p>Use the summary to orientate the user to the page by:</p>
<ul>
<li>keeping it active</li>
<li>including a verb</li>
<li>making it personal</li>
<li>including primary keywords</li>
<li>using plain English (no require, obtain etc)</li>
<li>keeping it succinct</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember: </p>
<ul>
<li>summaries take a full stop</li>
<li>you can use &lsquo;An introduction to...&lsquo; if it is an introduction (ie the guide is short and links out to other sources for the main information)</li>
<li>using &lsquo;How to&rsquo; etc is good</li>
<li>only use acronyms if they are very common  (eg EU, NATO, etc) or impossible to make a sensible sentence without</li>
</ul>

      <p>Examples:</p>
      <p>Title - Organic produce: how to become an importer</p>
      <p>Summary - Find out what organic products can be imported into the UK, how to register as an importer and how to get import authorisation.</p>
      
      <h3>Structure</h3>
      <p>Make sure your section titles are front-loaded with search terms and make them active. Avoid gerunds (eg &lsquo;Apply for a licence&rsquo; not &lsquo;Applying for a licence&rsquo;). Try not to use questions in section titles.</p>

    <p>Please don&rsquo;t use:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>technical terms in the section title unless unavoidable and then only if they have already been explained.</li>
      <li>&rsquo;introduction&lsquo; as your first section title. Users don’t want a first section that tells them what they will find in the rest of the guide - just tell them what the most important information is.</li>
      <li>FAQs &ndash;  these are normally written because users find content difficult to understand. If you make sure your content is concise and written in plain English, FAQs shouldn’t be necessary</li>
    </ul>
    
        <h3>Linking</h3>
        <p>Don’t swamp the user with links to other sites or link to the same tool or web page throughout the guide. It’s likely that the user has a particular action to complete or piece of information to find in the detailed guide and wants to do that as quickly as possible. Only link to other pages on GOV.UK or external sites if this is necessary for the the user to complete their journey.</p>
 
      
      
      <h2 id="news">8. News </h2>
        <p>News content directly follows the common style guide, with the exceptions listed below.</p>
        <p>News should not read like a press release &ndash; it should add value to a press release by increasing comprehensibility and user-focus, and removing spin.</p>

        <h2>Titles</h2>
        <p>What is the actual story? Tell it in a few words.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Minister visits factory&rdquo; is not a story. &ldquo;Vince Cable tells factory workers about workplace law reforms&rdquo; gives the reader a sense of what the story is about.</p>
        <p>Avoid &lsquo;teasing headlines&rsquo;, puns or wordplay &ndash; these make your story hard for people to find. Use the words most people use for the situation. This helps your search ranking.</p>
        <p>Avoid print conventions / &lsquo;journalese&rsquo; eg &ldquo;Minister in youth homelessness bid&rdquo; (&lsquo;bid&rsquo; is used in print where headline space is in short supply).</p>

        <p>Good example:<br />
          Granny in near-death wolf escape</p>

        <p>Bad example:<br />
          Girl goes into forest, encounters problems</p>

        <h2>Introductions</h2>
        <p>Introductions should be 15 to 50 words. Aim to tell the story in one or two sentences, eg who, what, where, when, why.</p>

        <h2>Body copy</h2>
        <p>Here's how to write effective body copy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the first paragraph of body copy should lead on from the introduction paragraph &ndash; it should not repeat the information</li>
          <li>use &lsquo;inverted pyramid&rsquo; approach with most important information at the top tapering down to lesser detail</li>
          <li>paragraphs should have no more than 5 sentences each</li>
          <li>large blocks of text should be split by regular sub-headers</li>
          <li>ensure copy includes keywords to boost natural search rankings</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Sub-headers</h2>
        <p>For news stories of fewer than than 150 words a sub-header below the introduction is discretionary.</p>

        <h2 id="policy">9. Policy pages</h2>
        <p>A policy is how the government plans to achieve a specific outcome.</p>

        <p>Policies on GOV.UK have 4 parts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a title</li>
          <li>a cover sheet</li>
          <li>latest tab (this is generated automatically)</li>
          <li>supporting detail pages</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Titles</h2>
        <p>Policy titles should express the specific outcome the government is seeking to achieve. They should be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>clear</li>
          <li>succinct</li>
          <li>specific enough to allow someone to measure progress and achievement</li>
          <li>jargon-free</li>
          <li>active: eg &lsquo;increasing x&rsquo;, &lsquo;reducing y&rsquo;, &lsquo;preventing z&rsquo;, &lsquo;protecting x from y&rsquo;</li>
          <li>related to an outcome</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Use words the wider audience would use. Don&rsquo;t use &lsquo;The x report&rsquo; unless that search term is higher than the explanation of what &lsquo;The x report&rsquo; says.</p>

        <p>Good examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Expanding and improving the rail network</li>
          <li>Making roads safer</li>
          <li>Increasing the number of successful small businesses</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Bad examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Charter for business</li>
          <li>Tackling climate change</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Issue (mandatory)</h2>
        <p>This should answer the question &lsquo;why does the government have this policy?&rsquo;.</p>
        <p>Give a short, clear and specific description of the problem or opportunity and a brief explanation of what the government is going to do or is doing about it.</p>
        <p>This section isn&rsquo;t:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>about the history</li>
          <li>what led to the policy being implemented</li>
          <li>the government&rsquo;s actions or intended actions</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>The public sector &ndash; including central government, local councils and devolved administrations &ndash; accounts for around 3% of the UK&rsquo;s carbon emissions. In England alone, the government spends &pound;2.5 billion on building energy and &pound;1.2 billion on owned-vehicle fuel.</p>
        <p>Improving energy efficiency in the public sector will result in a better use of taxpayers&rsquo; money and help the UK meet existing climate change agreements.</p>

        <h2>Actions (mandatory)</h2>
        <p>This section details what the government is doing about the issue or to achieve the outcome in the policy title.</p>
        <p>Actions should be specific, measurable and time-bound.</p>
        <p>Summarise briefly what government is doing now and what it will do next &ndash; one short paragraph or bullet point for each action with links to supporting detail pages where necessary.</p>
        <p>Past actions go into the background section. If an action was taken in the past but the effects are still being felt (eg the benefits of successfully lobbying the EU), then it is still current. If an action was taken, and then replaced by related and further action, policy, etc, then it&rsquo;s background.</p>

        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>To increase our energy efficiency, by 2015 the government will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% from the whole estate and business-related transport, by introducing x scheme</li>
          <li>make sure the goods, services and suppliers it chooses are energy efficient</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Background (mandatory)</h2>
        <p>This section should explain how this policy and set of actions came about. Provide essential information for understanding the context of the policy, issue and actions.</p>
        <p>This isn&rsquo;t a dumping ground for information that doesn&rsquo;t fit the other headings, nor a history of everything, but a clear indication of how the policy got to where it is.</p>

        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>We announced our intention to do x as part of the coalition agreement.</p>
        <p>We commissioned research into y in 2010. This showed that that the most cost-effective and useful action we could take would be to do z.</p>
        <p>We consulted experts at an event in 2011 and worked with aaa and bbb to develop our action plan.</p>

        <h2>Who we're consulting or who we&rsquo;ve consulted (optional and depending on time)</h2>
        <p>Explain who has been or will be consulted or involved in the policy, and in what way.</p>
        <p>List any consultations &ndash; formal or informal. Give some detail about what is being done and by whom, don&rsquo;t just add a list of links.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>The government ran a consultation on &lsquo;Breaking the cycle: effective punishment, rehabilitation and sentencing of offenders&rsquo;. This set out our proposals for effectively punishing and rehabilitating offenders and reforming sentencing. Following that consultation, we revised our plans to xxx and yyyy.</p>

        <h2>Impact (optional)</h2>
        <p>List (and link inline to) any impact assessment publications.</p>
        <p>Briefly summarise the main points arising from the impact assessments.</p>

        <h2>Bills and legislation (optional)</h2>
        <p>Give summary details of relevant legislation to explain the legal context for the policy and if the policy will mean changes to the law.</p> 
        <p>Write full sentences, not just a list of related laws, and add links where relevant.</p>

        <h2>Who we are working with (optional)</h2>
        <p>List the organisations which have a major involvement, and what work is being done by them or with them.</p>
        <p>Write full sentences, don&rsquo;t just list the organisations.</p>

        <h2>Detail pages (optional)</h2>
        <p>These pages are for users who want to know more about the actions listed on the cover sheet.</p>
        <p>They should provide supporting detail about the issue and actions.</p>
        <p>For example, if the actions include a programme costing &pound;x and running for 6 months, the detail page should provide further information about who is involved, what they are spending the money on and how.</p>
        <p>These pages must not be used as a dumping ground for material that doesn&rsquo;t fit under other headings.</p>
        <p>If appropriate, include a supplementary detail page called &lsquo;evidence&rsquo; or &lsquo;research&rsquo;. This can be used to present the most important research and statistics relating to the policy.</p>

        <h2 id="publications">10. Publications</h2>
        <h2>Titles</h2>
        <p>Titles don&rsquo;t have to reflect the &lsquo;official&rsquo; publication title. Keep them short and search- and user-friendly.</p>
        <p>Front-load all titles &ndash; get all the most important words at the front of the sentence.</p>

        <p>Good example:<br />
          Income Tax reform: impact assessment</p>

        <p>Bad example:<br />
          An assessment of the impact of proposed reforms to Income Tax</p>

        <p>You can mention the report title etc in the summary or page copy if you think users will search for that term.</p>

        <p>Good example:<br />
          &lsquo;Improving government online services&rsquo;</p>
        <p>Bad example:<br />
          &lsquo;The Varney report&rsquo;</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>This will be seen on section pages &ndash; not the publication page itself so <strong>don&rsquo;t use it for essential information</strong> unless that information is repeated in the body text. It&rsquo;s a short, snappy overview and takes a full stop.</p>
        <p>Write a 140 character summary &ndash; this will help with concise writing for search etc.</p>

        <h2>Body text &ndash; what it&rsquo;s for</h2>
        <p>The body of a publication page is used to provide a summary of the publication in plain, neutral language &ndash; to reassure the user that it is (or isn&rsquo;t) what they&rsquo;re looking for. Include what the publication is about and its purpose. Publications often outlive governments so keep the language politically neutral.</p>
        <p>Good example:<br/>
          These reports describe the effect of government proposals to reduce the amount of money spent on legal aid. The aim of the reforms is to make sure legal aid is still available for support and representation in cases where it is justified.</p>

        <h2>Attachments &ndash; title field</h2>
        <p>Use the official title of the document.</p>

        <h2>Things to check</h2>
        <p>Check the following have been populated:</p>
