        <h3>Inside Government</h3>
        <p>More advice on <a href="/designprinciples/styleguide/attribution">attribution for photos</a></p>
        <p>Add a line of text at the bottom of a page that says:</p>
        <p>Photo above by John Smith on Flickr. Used under Creative Commons.</p>

        <p>Link to the original photo on the [John Smith] words and link to  <a href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/>this Creative Commons licence</a> with the words &lsquo;Creative Commons&rsquo;.<br />

        <p>Where possible, write to the person to check if it&rsquo;s OK.</p>
        <p>Be careful if it's a sensitive issue that may cause offence. Use common sense. </p>

          <p>Putting it in an alt tag isn't good enough. If you need to attribute a photo on your department home page then put the attribution at the bottom of the content item that the image is associated with (it isn&rsquo;t possible to put text attribution on department home pages at the moment).</p>

        </p>
   
        
        
        <h2>Changes from 18 February, 2012</h2>
       <h3>GOV.UK overall style changes/improvements</h3>
        <p>Markdown on links: when adding meaningful markdown, eg: &rdquo;Apply for a show licence on the footwear website&rdquo;, first word should be capped. We do need to tell people they are going to a different website. </p>
        <p>Helplines in text: will be lower case. For example: &lsquo;For all enquiries on how to use colons, call the GDS helpline on 020 7654 321&rsquo; (that&rsquo;s not a real number, by the way.)</p>
        <p>We can use &lsquo;if&rsquo; in titles, if appropriate.</p>
        <p>We&rsquo;ve added more &lsquo;words to avoid&rsquo; and moved it out of policies and into the main guide, so this list of words and phrases now affects all of GOV.UK. It&rsquo;s under the <a href="/designprinciples/styleguide#words-to-avoid">1.5 words to avoid</a> section.</p>
        <p>There is also new <a href="/designprinciples/insidegovernment#accessible-pdfs">guidance on accessible PDFs</a></p>

        <h3>Inside Government changes</h3>
        <p>There is a lot of updated guidance for this section. I'd suggest you read it all. The only parts that haven&rsquo;t changed are: news, speeches, policies and the style differences. So have a look at these:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/designprinciples/insidegovernment#case-studies">Case studies</a></li>
          <li><a href="/designprinciples/insidegovernment#about-us">Corporate pages</a></li>
          <li><a href="/designprinciples/detailedguidance">Detailed guidance</a></li>
