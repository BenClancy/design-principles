          <h1>Organisation homepage</h1>
          <h2>‘Top tasks’ links</h2>
          <p>These are the links at the top right of the home page. They’re meant to help users who have arrived at your home page looking for a service that’s closely associated with your organisation, but is actually covered on the services and information part of GOV.UK.</p>
          <p>These links are optional: only keep them if there’s evidence that users are clicking on them. As a guide, each top task link should be followed by no fewer than 2% of total visitors to your homepage (measured in total unique pageviews).</p>
          <p>Links should point either to GOV.UK services and information (mainstream) content, or information or tools on domains outside GOV.UK. The text of the link must be as specific and active as possible, and not overlap with titles used for ‘corporate’ content types.</p>
          <p>Don’t include anything that’s already covered by a link on the organisation home page (eg contact details, lists of announcements or publications, blogs or social media channels).</p>
          <p>Don’t include microsites or campaign sites unless there’s evidence of significant user demand.</p>
          <h2>Feature slots</h2>
          <p>Don’t feel that you have to use all the feature slots: the fewer content items you feature, the more they stand out. Remember that anything you feature needs to have an image.</p>
          <h2>Contact details</h2>
          <p>Include a point of contact for general enquiries and a point of contact for freedom of information (FOI) requests. Additional contact details are optional.</p>
