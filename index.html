           <p>Normally, we&rsquo;re not starting from scratch - users are already using our services. This means we can watch and learn from real behaviour. We should do this, but we should make sure we continue this into the build and development process - prototyping and testing with real users on the live web.

                  <p>Similarly, there should be no need for a user to understand government to interact with it. Government (especially given the maturity of the British constitution) and the services it provides are often complicated, so we should hide complexity where possible.</p>

         <div class="outline">
           <p>The best way to build effective services is to start small and iterate wildly. Release Minimum Viable Products early, test them with real users, move from Alpha to Beta to Launch adding features and refinements based on feedback from real&nbsp;users. <img class="col-1of2-5" src="/app/assets/images/content/iterate_iterate.png" alt="" /></p>

             <p>Iteration reduces risk. It makes big failures unlikely and turns small failures into lessons.  And the alternative is 200 page spec documents which turn into bottlenecks. This again, is the core advantage of digital, we&rsquo;re not building bridges - things can be&nbsp;undone.</p>

                  <p>Once you’re happy with what some code is doing, make sure it is ‘clean’ and easy to read to aid future maintenance by yourself and others. You might also consider using this to reduce complexity and code ‘bloat’. If you’ve built something twice before, pause before doing it a third time and consider whether you can refactor avoid duplication. For instance, in your CSS, use classes rather than IDs to target commonly styled elements.</p>

           <p>Wherever possible we should use the same language and the same design patterns, this helps people get familiar with our services.
