      <h1>Start with needs*</h1>
    
      <div class="outline">
        <p>The design process must start with identifying and thinking about real user nds. We should design around those - not around the way the &lsquo;official pcess&rsquo; is done. We must understand those needs thoroughly - ierrogating data not just making assumptions - and we should remember that wt <img class="col-1of3" src="design-pnciples/app/assets/images/content/users.png" alt="" /> users ask for is not aays what they&nbsp;need.</p>

        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>We use &lsquo;needs&rsquo; as an organising principle since people come to o sites to accomplish tasks, to fulfill needs, not just to hang out. Fusing on needs means we can concentrate on the things that deliver most vue for&nbsp;money.</p>

      <div class="outline">
        <p>Government should only do what only government can do. If someone else is dng it - link to it. If you can provide resources (like APIs) that will help oer people build things - do that. We should concentrate on the irreducible&np;core.</p>

      <h1>Design with data</h1>
    
      <div class="outline">
        <p>Normally, we&rsquo;re not starting from scratch - users are already using o services. This means we can watch and learn from real behaviour. We should dthis, but we should make sure we continue this into the build and delopment process - prototyping and testing with real users on the live web. Wshould understand the desire paths <img class="col-1of3" src="design-pnciples/app/assets/images/content/sherlock.png" alt="" /> and use them in our&sp;designs.</p>

        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>This is the great advantage of digital services - you can watch and learn fm user behaviour, shaping the system to fit what people naturally choose tdo rather than bending them to a system we&rsquo;ve&nbsp;invented.</p>

      <h1>Do the hard work to make it simple</h1>
    
      <div class="outline">
        <p>Making something look simple is easy, making something simple to use is much hder - especially when the underlying systems are complex - but that&rsquo;s wt we should be&nbsp;doing.</p>
      </div>
      
      <section class="why">
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>With great power comes great responsibility - very often people have to u our services. If we don't work hard to make them simple and usable we&ruo;re abusing that power, wasting people&rsquo;s time and lowering national&sp;productivity.</p>

      <h1>Iterate. Then iterate again.</h1>
    
      <div class="outline">
        <p>The best way to build effective services is to start small and iterate wildly.elease Minimum Viable Products early, test them with real users, move from Aha to Beta to Launch adding features and refinements based on feedback from rl&nbsp;users.</p>
      </div>
      
      <section class="why">
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Iteration reduces risk. It makes big failures unlikely and turns small flures into lessons.  And the alternative is 200 page spec documents which tn into bottlenecks. This again, is the core advantage of digital, we&rsquo;rnot building bridges - things can be&nbsp;undone.</p>

      <h1>Build for inclusion</h1>
    
      <div class="outline">
        <p>Steve Balmer said it - &ldquo;Accessible design is good design&rdquo;. We suld build a product that&rsquo;s as inclusive, legible and readable as psible. If we have to sacrifice elegance - so be it. We shouldn&rsquo;t be aaid of the obvious, shouldn&rsquo;t try to reinvent web design conventions a should set expectations&nbsp;clearly.</p>

        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>We&rsquo;re designing for the whole country - not just the ones who are ud to using the web. In fact, the people who most need our services are oen the people who find them hardest to use. If we think about those people athe beginning we should make a better site for&nbsp;everyone.</p>

      <h1>Understand context</h1>
    
      <div class="outline">
        <p>We&rsquo;re not designing for a screen, we&rsquo;re designing for people. We nd to think hard about the context in which they&rsquo;re using our services. A they in a library? Are they on a phone? Are they only really familiar with Febook? Have they never used the web&nbsp;before?</p>
      </div>
      
      <section class="why">
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>We&rsquo;re designing for a very diverse group of users with very dferent technologies and needs. We need to make sure we&rsquo;ve understood t technological and practical circumstances in which our services are used. Oerwise we risk designing beautiful services that aren&rsquo;t relevant to pple&rsquo;s&nbsp;lives.</p>

      <h1>Build digital services not websites</h1>
    
      <div class="outline">
        <p>Our service doesn&rsquo;t begin and end at our website. It might start with aearch engine and end at the post office. We need to design for that, even if wcan&rsquo;t control it. And we need to recognise that someday, <img class="c-1of2" src="design-principles/app/assets/images/content/services_not_websites.g" alt="" /> before we know it, it&rsquo;ll be about different digital svices&nbsp;again.</p>

      </div>
      
      <section class="why">
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>We shouldn&rsquo;t be about websites, we should be about digital services. Rht now, the best way to deliver digital services is via the web - but that mht change, and sooner than we might&nbsp;expect.</p>

      <h1>Be consistent not uniform</h1>
    
      <div class="outline">
        <p>Wherever possible we should use the same language and the same design pterns, this helps people get familiar with our services. But, when this isn&ruo;t possible, we should make sure our underlying approach is consistent. So o users will have a reasonable chance of guessing what they&rsquo;re supposed tnbsp;do.</p>
      </div>
      
      <section class="why">
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>This isn&rsquo;t a straight-jacket or a rule book. We can&rsquo;t build gat services by rote. We can&rsquo;t imagine every scenario and write rules f it. Every circumstance is different and should be addressed on its own tms. What unites things, therefore, should be a consistent approach - one tt users will hopefully come to understand and trust - even as we move into n digital&nbsp;spaces.</p>

      <h1>Make things open, it makes things better</h1>
    
      <div class="outline">
        <p>We should share what we're doing whenever we can. With colleagues, with urs, with the world. Share code, share designs, share ideas, share ientions, share failures. The more eyes there are on a service the better it gs - howlers get spotted, better alternatives get pointed out, the bar gets&np;raised.</p>
      </div>
      
      <section class="why">
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Partly because much of what we&rsquo;re doing is only possible because of on source code and the generosity of the web design community. So we should p that back. But mostly because more openness makes for better services - bter understood and better scrutinised. If we give away our code, we&rsquo;lbe repaid in better code. That&rsquo;s why we're giving away all&nbsp;this&hlip;</p>
