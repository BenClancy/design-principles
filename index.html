            The design process must start with identifying and thinking about real
            user needs. We should design around those - not around the way the
            ‘official process’ is done. We must understand those needs thoroughly
            - interrogating data not just making assumptions - and we should
            remember that what users ask for is not always what they need.</p>

             <p>We use ‘needs’ as an organising principle since people come to our
              sites to accomplish tasks, to fulfill needs, not just to hang out.
              Focusing on needs means we can concentrate on the things that deliver
              most value for money.</p>

                  <p>This VAT page is a good example of a design that results from thinking about user needs. Most people will arrive at this page after a search for VAT rates. The answer most people are after is 20%, so we've made that the largest, clearest piece of information on the page. You can get the answer you are looking for incredibly quickly. There is more to VAT than just one rate so we've included this but clearly designed as secondary information. There's a slim chance you've arrived at the wrong page so we have links to genuinely related items in the box on the top right.</p>
                  <p>The page is simple and clear but contains all the different information you might need.</p>

           <p>The best way to build effective services is to start small and iterate
            wildly. Release Minimum Viable Products early, test them with real
            users, move from Alpha to Beta to Launch adding features and

              failures into lessons.  And the alternative is 200 page spec documents
              which turn into bottlenecks. This again, is the core advantage of
              digital, we’re not building bridges - things can be undone.</p>

You might also consider using this to reduce complexity and code ‘bloat’. If you’ve built something twice before, pause before doing it a third time and consider whether you can refactor avoid duplication. For instance, in your CSS, use classes rather than IDs to target commonly styled elements.</p>

            this isn’t possible, we should make sure our underlying approach is

              it. Every circumstance is different and should be addressed on its own
              terms. What unites things, therefore, should be a consistent approach
              - one that users will hopefully come to understand and trust - even as
              we move into new digital spaces.</p>

            share intentions, share failures. The more eyes there are on a service
            the better it gets - howlers get spotted, better alternatives get
            pointed out, the bar gets raised.</p>

             <p>Partly because much of what we’re doing is only possible because of
              open source code and the generosity of the web design community. So we
              should pay that back. But mostly because more openness makes for
              better services - better understood and better scrutinised. If we give
              away our code, we’ll be repaid in better code. That’s why we’re giving
