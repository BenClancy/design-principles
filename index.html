         <div class="outline">
           <p>The design process must start with identifying and thinking about real user needs. We should design around those - not around the way the &lsquo;official process&rsquo; is done. We must understand those needs thoroughly - interrogating data not just making assumptions - and we should remember that what users ask for is not always what they&nbsp;need.</p>

             <p>We use &lsquo;needs&rsquo; as an organising principle since people come to our sites to accomplish tasks, to fulfill needs, not just to hang out. Focusing on needs means we can concentrate on the things that deliver most value for&nbsp;money.</p>

         <div class="outline">
           <p>Normally, we&rsquo;re not starting from scratch - users are already using our services. This means we can watch and learn from real behaviour. We should do this, but we should make sure we continue this into the build and development process - prototyping and testing with real users on the live web. We should understand the desire paths <img class="col-1of2-5" src="design-principles/app/assets/images/content/sherlock.png" alt="" /> and use them in our&nbsp;designs.</p>

           <h2>Why?</h2>
           <div class="content">
             <p>This is the great advantage of digital services - you can watch and learn from user behaviour, shaping the system to fit what people naturally choose to do rather than bending them to a system we&rsquo;ve&nbsp;invented.</p>

         <div class="outline">
           <p>Making something look simple is easy, making something simple to use is much harder - especially when the underlying systems are complex - but that&rsquo;s what we should be&nbsp;doing.</p>
         </div>
         
         <section class="why">
           <h2>Why?</h2>
           <div class="content">
             <p>With great power comes great responsibility - very often people have to use our services. If we don't work hard to make them simple and usable we&rsquo;re abusing that power, wasting people&rsquo;s time and lowering national&nbsp;productivity.</p>

         <h1>Iterate. Then iterate again.</h1>
       
         <div class="outline">
           <p>The best way to build effective services is to start small and iterate wildly. Release Minimum Viable Products early, test them with real users, move from Alpha to Beta to Launch adding features and refinements based on feedback from real&nbsp;users.</p>
         </div>
         
         <section class="why">
           <h2>Why?</h2>
           <div class="content">
             <p>Iteration reduces risk. It makes big failures unlikely and turns small failures into lessons.  And the alternative is 200 page spec documents which turn into bottlenecks. This again, is the core advantage of digital, we&rsquo;re not building bridges - things can be&nbsp;undone.</p>

           <p>Steve Balmer said it - &ldquo;Accessible design is good design&rdquo;. We should build a product that&rsquo;s as inclusive, legible and readable as possible. If we have to sacrifice elegance - so be it. We shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid of the obvious, shouldn&rsquo;t try to reinvent web design conventions and should set expectations&nbsp;clearly.</p>

             <p>We&rsquo;re designing for the whole country - not just the ones who are used to using the web. In fact, the people who most need our services are often the people who find them hardest to use. If we think about those people at the beginning we should make a better site for&nbsp;everyone.</p>

         <div class="outline">
           <p>We&rsquo;re not designing for a screen, we&rsquo;re designing for people. We need to think hard about the context in which they&rsquo;re using our services. Are they in a library? Are they on a phone? Are they only really familiar with Facebook? Have they never used the web&nbsp;before?</p>

           <div class="content">
             <p>We&rsquo;re designing for a very diverse group of users with very different technologies and needs.

           <p>Our service doesn&rsquo;t begin and end at our website. It might start with a search engine and end at the post office. We need to design for that, even if we can&rsquo;t control it. And we need to recognise that someday, <img class="col-1of2" src="design-principles/app/assets/images/content/services_not_websites.png" alt="" /> before we know it, it&rsquo;ll be about different digital services&nbsp;again.</p>

         <div class="outline">
           <p>Wherever possible we should use the same language and the same design patterns, this helps people get familiar with our services. But, when this isn&rsquo;t possible, we should make sure our underlying approach is consistent. So our users will have a reasonable chance of guessing what they&rsquo;re supposed to&nbsp;do.</p>

             <p>This isn&rsquo;t a straight-jacket or a rule book. We can&rsquo;t build great services by rote. We can&rsquo;t imagine every scenario and write rules for it. Every circumstance is different and should be addressed on its own terms. What unites things, therefore, should be a consistent approach - one that users will hopefully come to understand and trust - even as we move into new digital&nbsp;spaces.</p>

           <p>We should share what we're doing whenever we can. With colleagues, with users, with the world. Share code, share designs, share ideas, share intentions, share failures. The more eyes there are on a service the better it gets - howlers get spotted, better alternatives get pointed out, the bar gets&nbsp;raised.</p>

             <p>Partly because much of what we&rsquo;re doing is only possible because of open source code and the generosity of the web design community. So we should pay that back. But mostly because more openness makes for better services - better understood and better scrutinised. If we give away our code, we&rsquo;ll be repaid in better code.
